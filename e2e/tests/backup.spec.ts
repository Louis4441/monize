// Backup & restore. Export downloads a backup of all the user's data.
//
// Backups are encrypted with the user's own password, captured when they
// register or sign in. `ENCRYPTION_KEY` is required for the backend to start at
// all, so there is no environment in which that capture silently does not
// happen -- this suite therefore drives the encrypted download, prompt and all
// (issue #1269, where the key was optional and every backup came out in clear).
//
// The restore round-trip wipes and replaces all data; driving it end-to-end in
// a browser is deferred (see ROADMAP Phase 3.4) -- the wipe appears to
// invalidate the active session, so asserting the restored data in the same
// page session isn't reliable. Restore is covered by backend tests.
