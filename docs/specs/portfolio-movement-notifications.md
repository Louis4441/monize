# Spec: portfolio-movement notifications

Status: **proposed, awaiting maintainer approval.** The measure and the product
decisions below were confirmed with the feature's requester (the branch author);
they still need the maintainer's sign-off before this ships to `main`. Scope from
discussion #1291 (the `investments` group, "significant portfolio movement") and
the maintainer's answer "investment / portfolio-movement alerts: your choice,
could be useful" (kenlasko/monize#1291, 2026-09-01; recorded in
`notification-preferences.md` Section 16.1).

Owner: notification-center. Related: #1291, `notification-preferences.md`,
`fx-conversion-completeness.md` (the completeness contract this producer must
obey), `financial-calculation-contract.md` (a subtotal is not a total),
INV-NOTIFY-001 (the write door).

---

## 1. What this adds, and the requester's actual requirement

Once per day, the Notification Center measures the **market-driven** change in the
value of the user's investment accounts and, when it exceeds the user's configured
percentage, raises one notification (`investments` category).

The requirement, verbatim: *"a feature that says once a day about the change in
value of investment accounts, but not that the value changed because I deposited
money."* So the movement this reports is **not** the day-over-day change in total
value. A deposit raises the total without the market having moved, and reporting
that as "your portfolio moved +5%" is exactly the false signal to avoid. The
figure is the change **net of the money the user put in or took out**.

Three rules, and the second and third are what make this hard:

1. **Crossing, not level** (as for every producer): fire once when the day's
   movement first exceeds the threshold, not on every observation of a value.
2. **Net of external flows** (Section 2): the reported movement excludes cash the
   user moved across the boundary of their investment accounts. Dividends,
   interest, buys and sells are *internal* to those accounts and are **kept** in
   the movement (they are return); deposits and withdrawals from outside are
   *external* and are **removed**.
3. **A subtotal is not a total** (`fx-conversion-completeness.md`): the value spans
   currencies and priced securities, and the flow spans currencies, so a movement
   computed from an **incomplete** valuation or an **unconvertible** flow is a
   confident false number. If any component is unknown, the movement is
   **unknown**, the alert is **withheld**, and the baseline is **not** advanced.
   This is the #1247/#1125 family of bug.

## 1.1 Why "net of external flows" is the measure (and why dividends decide it)

Two measures were considered.

- **Price-only** -- sum over today's holdings of `quantity x (price_today -
  price_prevClose)`. It excludes deposits (a deposit changes no quantity), but it
  **misreports a dividend**: on the ex-dividend date the security price drops by
  roughly the dividend while the cash the dividend paid lands in the account, so a
  price-only measure shows the drop as a **loss** the user did not take. Rejected
  for that reason.
- **Change in value minus external flow** (adopted) -- the modified-Dietz
  numerator over the set of investment accounts. A dividend is an *internal* flow
  (cash from a holding the user already owns, not from their pocket), so it is not
  removed; the ex-date price drop is offset by the dividend cash and the day nets
  to ~0, which is correct -- the user neither gained nor lost, value moved from the
  share price into their cash. Buys and sells are internal too (cash <-> securities
  inside the set), so they net to zero in the value and are not removed. Only cash
  crossing the boundary from outside is removed. This is the only one of the two
  that is right for dividends, and dividends are why it was chosen.

---

## 2. The measure

Let `A` be the set of the user's **investment accounts** -- both the
`INVESTMENT_CASH` sleeve and the `INVESTMENT_BROKERAGE` sleeve (an INVESTMENT
account is a pair; `investment-filter.util.ts` is the one place that rule is
written, and this producer uses it rather than an account-type predicate by hand).

- `MV(t)` = the market value of `A` at date `t`, in the user's reporting currency:
  the market value of the security holdings plus the cash balances, priced and
  converted through `getPortfolioSummary` -- the same aggregate, resolver and
  completeness flag every other investment surface reads. `MV(t)` carries a
  completeness bit: `getPortfolioSummary(...).valuationComplete`.
- `externalFlow(day)` = the net cash that crossed `A`'s boundary **from outside
  `A`** since the baseline, in the reporting currency:
  - **included** (external): an ordinary deposit or withdrawal in an account of
    `A`; a transfer leg in `A` whose counterparty account is **not** in `A`;
  - **excluded** (internal): every investment-linked cash leg (BUY / SELL /
    DIVIDEND / interest / fees -- identified by `investmentLinkedTransactionExclusion`
    / `investmentLinkedSplitExclusion`, never by hand); a transfer leg in `A` whose
    counterparty account is **also** in `A` (a move within the set);
    a `VOID` or future-dated row (moved no balance).
  `externalFlow` carries its own completeness bit: if any included flow cannot be
  converted to the reporting currency (a missing rate), the flow is **incomplete**.
- `movement(day)` = `MV(today) - MV(baseline) - externalFlow(day)`.
- `movementPercent(day)` = `movement(day) / MV(baseline) * 100`, computed only when
  `MV(baseline) > 0`.

The percentage is the day's **market return** on the starting value, excluding the
user's own contributions. A positive movement is a gain the market produced; a
negative one is a loss the market produced; a deposit-only day is `movement ~= 0`.

---

## 3. Invariants

- **INV-PORTMOVE-001 (complete, or withhold and do not advance).** A movement is
  computed and an alert considered only when the current `MV` **and** the baseline
  `MV` were both captured with `valuationComplete === true` **and** the
  `externalFlow` is complete. If any is incomplete, there is no alert **and** the
  baseline is not advanced -- advancing on a subtotal makes the *next* comparison
  wrong too. An incomplete run is a no-op.
- **INV-PORTMOVE-002 (unknown is not zero).** A missing price, a missing rate, or
  an unconvertible flow makes the movement unknown, never `0%` and never "no
  movement". Every completeness read is `=== true` (defensive; an absent flag
  during a rolling deploy reads as incomplete), never `!incomplete`.
- **INV-PORTMOVE-003 (one currency).** `MV(today)`, `MV(baseline)` and
  `externalFlow` are all in the user's reporting currency, resolved through the one
  shared reader (`preferredCurrency` / `resolveUserDefaultCurrency`,
  `default-currency.util.ts`; never a local `reportingCurrency` alias, which
  `default-currency.guard.spec.ts` would fail). A baseline captured in a different
  reporting currency is not compared -- a reporting-currency change re-baselines
  (D5).
- **INV-PORTMOVE-004 (baseline value 0 has no percentage).** When `MV(baseline)`
  is `0` (no holdings, or first holdings), the percentage is undefined; the
  producer raises nothing and records the new complete baseline. A first non-zero
  value is not a "movement".
- **INV-PORTMOVE-005 (one writer, isolated).** Written through
  `NotificationDispatchService.notify` -> `NotificationService.create`
  (INV-NOTIFY-001), from a cron under `withSystemContext` fan-out /
  `withUserContext` body, **after** the day's price refresh. It never hooks a price
  or balance write.
- **INV-PORTMOVE-006 (movement is a market return, never a contribution).** The
  external flow is always subtracted; a deposit-only day never fires. The flow is
  derived through `investment-filter.util.ts`, so an auto-generated trade leg is
  never counted as a contribution and a dividend is never counted as one either.
- **INV-PORTMOVE-007 (a flow is worth its own day's rate).** Status:
  **enforced**. The external flow is read per day
  (`loadExternalFlowSubtotals({ perDay: true })`) and each `(date, currency)`
  subtotal is converted at **that date's** rate, through the one resolver
  (`ExchangeRateService.getRateForDate`, historical mode, INV-FX-001). Folding a
  multi-day window at the run day's rate moves the FX difference between the two
  dates into the movement and reports it as a market return -- a Monday run
  priced Friday's and Saturday's deposits at Monday's close. A `(date, currency)`
  pair with no rate makes the flow incomplete, and `missingPairs` names the day
  as well as the pair, because a withheld figure has to say what would repair it.
  Held by `portfolio-flow.util.spec.ts` (the fold), the producer's spec (the
  dates it asks the resolver for) and `test/integration/portfolio-movement-flow.integration.spec.ts`
  (the same rows through real SQL).
- **INV-PORTMOVE-008 (a late close restates the baseline; it is not the
  period's move).** Status: **enforced**. Valuation legitimately carries a close
  forward (`docs/time-series-contract.md` section 2.1, second exception) and a
  position carried at an old close contributes the same figure to both ends of
  the comparison -- until the run in which its new close arrives, which would
  book the whole catch-up since the old close as one period's market move (the
  94% "movement" in kenlasko/monize#1391). So every stored baseline records, per
  security held in a non-zero quantity, the close that valued it and the date
  that close was struck on (`baseline_positions`, Section 4). A baseline position
  is **late** when its close was struck more than `LATE_PRICE_TOLERANCE_DAYS` (4)
  calendar days before `baseline_captured_on` and the security's latest
  observation is now a different one (a new date, or a corrected close); the
  tolerance keeps a feed that routinely runs a session behind (a fund's NAV
  published next morning, a Monday run over Friday's close) inside the period.
  Each late position adds `baselineQuantity x (newClose - oldClose)` at today's
  rate to the baseline -- the baseline restated at the close that arrived -- and
  the movement is measured against the restated baseline. The period's FX move
  on the old close stays in the movement, because the rate is the period's own
  evidence. A position sold since the baseline is restated too, from its latest
  observation, since its proceeds are in today's cash at the new price. The
  restatement travels in the alert (`latePriceAdjustment`, and `latePrices`
  naming each security, the two close dates and what it added). The dates come
  from the very observations that priced today's value
  (`PortfolioService.getLatestPriceObservations`, the dated form of the query
  `getLatestPrices` runs); the policy is `latePriceAdjustment` and the snapshot
  `snapshotPositions` (`notification-center/portfolio-price-freshness.util.ts`).

  **Nothing is withheld on account of a carried close.** The rule this replaces
  withheld the run and kept the baseline while any held close predated the
  baseline date; since the baseline never advanced, one holding priced by hand
  (or whose feed had died) silenced the alert for good (kenlasko/monize#1435). A
  carried close that is still the latest contributes nothing, and the baseline
  advances on every complete run. Two arms keep the rule from ever stalling: a
  late close that cannot be valued (no rate for a sold position's currency, or
  no observation left) makes the movement unknown, so nothing fires, but the
  baseline still moves to today's complete value rather than keeping the closes
  that made it unknown; and a baseline stored without its closes (every row
  written before the column existed) is replaced, not compared, exactly as an
  undated one is.

---

## 4. State (new)

There is **no daily portfolio-value snapshot in the codebase** -- only monthly
`monthly_account_balances.market_value`, too coarse for a day-over-day movement.
So the producer keeps its own minimal per-user state, a new user-owned table
`notification_portfolio_state`:

```
user_id                UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
move_alert_percent     NUMERIC(9,4)  NULL   -- threshold; NULL = off (default, opt-in)
baseline_value         NUMERIC(20,4) NULL   -- last COMPLETE MV (INV-PORTMOVE-001)
baseline_currency      CHAR(3)       NULL   -- reporting currency baseline_value is in
baseline_captured_on   DATE          NULL   -- the day the baseline MV was measured
baseline_positions     JSONB         NULL   -- per held security: quantity, close,
                                            -- close date, currency (INV-PORTMOVE-008)
```

- RLS: user-owned; policy + `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` in the same migration, in
  `schema.sql`, and in the direct-table array. Classify in
  `support-backup-rules.ts` (a new `RULES` entry -- every column classified, or the
  coverage guard fails) and add to `export-table-queries.ts` and `restore-plan.ts`
  after `users` (or to `INTENTIONALLY_EXCLUDED_TABLES` with a reason -- it is a
  per-user setting plus a derived baseline, so **exported**). `entity` declares any
  index it arbitrates on (there is none here beyond the PK).
- `baseline_positions` is written with the baseline it belongs to, in the same
  statement, and is `drop` in the support backup: it is derived quantities and
  closes, and a baseline without it is simply replaced on the next run.
- `NULL move_alert_percent` = off. The default is off; the feature is opt-in.

---

## 5. New notification type, category and copy

- `NotificationType`: `PORTFOLIO_MOVEMENT` (<= 30 chars). One type; the direction
  travels in `data.direction` and the sign of `data.changePercent`. The sign is
  provable here (a complete value minus a complete value minus a complete flow), so
  it is safe to carry, unlike a mixed-sign split-parent snapshot.
- `NotificationCategory`: `INVESTMENTS = "INVESTMENTS"`.
- `notificationCategoryOf` maps `PORTFOLIO_MOVEMENT -> INVESTMENTS`;
  `typesForCategory(INVESTMENTS)` includes it.
- `NOTIFICATION_CATEGORY_CHANNELS` gains `INVESTMENTS`
  (`{ email: true, emailNotification: true, push: true, unifiedpush: true }`);
  `NOTIFICATION_PREFERENCE_CATEGORIES` gains it; `PUSH_CATEGORY_COPY` gains its
  generic copy plus `push.notification.investments` (English-first, pseudo
  regenerated). The frontend mirror (`notification-preferences.ts`), the client
  copy composition and the `notification-target` mapping follow, held by the same
  three contract tests.
- Deep link: `target: "/investments"` (the route exists:
  `frontend/src/app/investments/page.tsx`), asserted by
  `notification-target.contract.test.ts`.

---

## 6. The producer

Cron service `PortfolioMovementAlertService`, scheduled **after** the daily price
refresh so the current value is priced. Percentages are compared at full precision
and only rounded for display (`PORTFOLIO_MOVE_PERCENT_DECIMALS`, a ratio -- never
`roundMoney`, which is 4dp money precision and would misstate a percentage; see the
"an exchange rate is not money" rule, which a ratio shares).

```
for each user with move_alert_percent set:            // withSystemContext fan-out
  withUserContext(userId):                            // one identity per user
    const ccy = preferredCurrency(pref)               // shared resolver (INV-...-003)
    const s = portfolio.getPortfolioSummary(userId)   // MV(today) + completeness
    if (s.valuationComplete !== true) return           // INV-PORTMOVE-001/002 no-op
    const mvToday = s.totalPortfolioValue              // holdings + cash, in ccy
    if (baseline == null || baselineCurrency !== ccy
        || baseline_captured_on == null
        || baseline_positions == null):               // no period / no closes
        record baseline = { mvToday, ccy, today, closes }; return   // 003/004/005
    const flow = externalFlow(A, baseline_captured_on, today)       // Section 2
    if (!flow.complete) return                          // INV-PORTMOVE-001/002 no-op
    const late = latePriceAdjustment(baseline_positions, ...)       // INV-PORTMOVE-008
    if (!late.complete):
        record baseline = { mvToday, ccy, today, closes }; return   // unknown, never stall
    const restated = baseline_value + late.total
    if (restated == 0):
        record baseline = { mvToday, ccy, today, closes }; return   // INV-PORTMOVE-004
    const movement = mvToday - restated - flow.value
    const pct = movement / restated * 100
    if (Math.abs(pct) >= move_alert_percent):
        dispatch.notify(userId, {
          type: PORTFOLIO_MOVEMENT,
          severity: NotificationSeverity.INFO,          // D4
          title, message,
          data: { changePercent: round(pct, PORTFOLIO_MOVE_PERCENT_DECIMALS),
                  direction: pct >= 0 ? "up" : "down",
                  movementValue: movement, baselineValue: baseline_value,
                  currentValue: mvToday, externalFlow: flow.value,
                  latePriceAdjustment: late.total, latePrices: late.items,
                  baselineDate: baseline_captured_on, valuationDate: today,
                  currencyCode: ccy },
          target: "/investments",
          dedupeKey: `portmove:${ccy}:${today}`,        // one per day, per user
        })
    record baseline = { mvToday, ccy, today, closes }    // rebaseline each complete run
```

**What makes a re-run safe is the dedupe key, not one long transaction.** The
evaluation is not wrapped in a single transaction: the baseline read
(`loadState`), the baseline write (`storeBaseline`) and the notification each
run in their own `withScopedDb` call under the user's identity. Nothing between
them is a read-modify-write of a row another writer contends for -- this cron is
the only writer of `notification_portfolio_state.baseline_*`, guarded by the
per-process `running` flag, and `storeBaseline` is one `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT
DO UPDATE` -- and a second run of the same day recomputes the same figures from
the same rows. The notification is idempotent on the key: `dedupeKey` is scoped
per user by `idx_notifications_dedupe`, the partial unique index on
`notifications(user_id, dedupe_key)`, so at most one movement alert per user
exists for a day (the key itself carries the reporting currency and the day, not
the user id). Delivery, throttle and fan-out are the seam's. The baseline
advances to today's complete `MV` on every complete run whether or not it fired,
so the next day measures from today.

**An undated baseline is replaced, never compared against.** A stored value and
currency with no `baseline_captured_on` names no period: the external flow has no
window to span (INV-PORTMOVE-007) and no held position's close can be late
against it (INV-PORTMOVE-008), so the run records a fresh baseline instead of
computing a difference whose opening date would have to be invented.
`decideMovement` takes `baselineDateKnown` and refuses on that arm, which is why
the producer needs no fallback date when it stamps `baselineDate`.

**The alert names what it measured.** The period is both boundary dates
(`baselineValue`, `currentValue`, `externalFlow`, `latePriceAdjustment`) in the
one currency, with each late close named in `latePrices`, so a reader can
reproduce it instead of trusting it: `movementValue = currentValue -
baselineValue - latePriceAdjustment - externalFlow`, over `baselineValue +
latePriceAdjustment`. The copy says the period -- a
Monday run measures from Friday, and "today" was wrong as often as it was right.
No new column: `notification_portfolio_state.baseline_captured_on` already is the
period's opening date, and `valuationDate` is the run's own day. A row written
before the producer carried these falls back WHOLE to its stored English copy
rather than being relabelled with a day it was never about.

---

## 7. Numerical examples

Reporting currency USD, threshold 5%. `MV` = holdings + cash of the investment
accounts.

```
day 1: MV=100,000 complete                       -> baseline=100,000 (first; no alert)
day 2: MV=103,000 complete, flow=0
       movement=+3,000, pct=+3.00% < 5%           -> silent; rebaseline 103,000
day 3: MV=113,000 complete, flow=+12,000 (deposit)
       movement=113,000-103,000-12,000=-2,000
       pct=-1.94% < 5%                            -> silent (a 10k deposit did NOT
                                                     fire a +9.7% "gain"); rebaseline
day 4: MV=118,000 complete, flow=0 (dividend day)
       the dividend is internal, not in flow; the ex-date price drop is offset by
       the dividend cash inside MV
       movement=+5,000, pct=+4.42% < 5%           -> silent; rebaseline 118,000
day 5: MV=108,000 complete, flow=0
       movement=-10,000, pct=-8.47% >= 5%         -> FIRE down; rebaseline 108,000
day 6: MV=110,000 INCOMPLETE (one holding unpriced)
       valuationComplete=false                    -> NO-OP: no alert, baseline stays
                                                     108,000 (INV-PORTMOVE-001)
day 7: flow FX rate for a EUR deposit missing     -> flow incomplete -> NO-OP
```

Day 3 is the requester's requirement (a deposit does not fire); day 4 is the
dividend correctness; days 6-7 are "a subtotal is not a total" on each of the two
completeness sources.

---

## 8. Missing-data policy

- `valuationComplete !== true` on the current run -> no alert, no rebaseline.
- `externalFlow` incomplete (any included `(date, currency)` subtotal
  unconvertible **at its own date**, INV-PORTMOVE-007) -> no alert, no
  rebaseline.
- A held position still carried at an old close (INV-PORTMOVE-008) -> nothing
  special: it contributes the same close to both ends, and the run fires or
  rebaselines normally. When its new close arrives, the jump restates the
  baseline and is named in the alert; it is never the period's move.
- A late close that cannot be valued -> no alert, but rebaseline (keeping the
  closes that made it unknown would make every later run unknown).
- A baseline without its per-security closes -> no alert, rebaseline.
- A stored baseline is only ever a complete `MV`.
- `baseline_value == 0` -> undefined percentage -> no alert, rebaseline only.
- No value is defaulted, no flow is defaulted to zero, no percentage is computed
  from a subtotal. Withholding is at the producer -- the honest place for a batch
  job with no reader waiting.

---

## 9. Deliberate trades

- **The producer owns its baseline; it does not add a daily snapshot table for
  everyone.** It needs only "the last complete `MV` I saw" -- one row per opted-in
  user. If a general daily snapshot is later built, this baseline reads from it.
- **Day-over-day, not intraday.** Intraday value is computed live and cached 60s;
  alerting on it would be noisy. A daily period matches "significant movement" and
  the once-a-day price refresh.
- **Fire only above a threshold, not a daily heartbeat** (requester's choice): a
  quiet day is silent; the alert is a crossing, consistent with every other
  producer, not a daily digest.
- **One type, signed data.** The sign is provable (complete value - complete value
  - complete flow), so up/down is a `data` field, not two types.

---

## 10. Decisions (confirmed with the requester; maintainer signs off)

- **D0. Build it.** The requester asked for it explicitly ("na pewno chce" -- "I
  definitely want"). The `investments` category is created with it.
- **D1. Measure = change in value minus external flow** (Section 1.1), because it
  is the only measure that is correct for dividends.
- **D2. Default off, opt-in per user**; one percentage threshold once enabled
  (default e.g. 5%). Absolute-amount threshold deferred.
- **D3. Fire only when `|movementPercent| >= move_alert_percent`** (requester's
  choice: threshold, not a daily heartbeat).
- **D4. Aggregate = `getPortfolioSummary().totalPortfolioValue`** (investment
  accounts' holdings + cash), not whole-account net worth. #1291 says "portfolio".
- **D5. Cadence = daily**, chained after the price refresh; the period key is the
  calendar day in the user's timezone.
- **D6. Severity `INFO`** (informational). A large drop is still `INFO`; the
  message carries the number and direction.
- **D7. Reporting-currency change re-baselines** (no cross-currency comparison,
  INV-PORTMOVE-003).
- **D8. Baseline storage = a dedicated `notification_portfolio_state` table**
  (a threshold plus a derived baseline is not a "preference" and does not belong
  on `user_preferences`).

## 11. Test matrix (offline-runnable except where noted)

1. **Deposit does not fire** (INV-PORTMOVE-006): a large deposit with no market
   move yields `movement ~= 0` and no alert (day 3).
2. **Dividend is return, not a loss** (INV-PORTMOVE-006): an ex-dividend day where
   price drops and the dividend cash lands nets to ~0 movement, never a loss.
3. **Buy/sell internal**: a same-day buy funded from the cash sleeve does not move
   the measure (cash <-> securities inside the set).
4. **Withhold on incomplete value** (INV-PORTMOVE-001/002): an unpriced holding ->
   `valuationComplete=false` -> no alert, baseline unchanged (day 6).
5. **Withhold on incomplete flow**: a deposit in a currency with no rate -> flow
   incomplete -> no alert, baseline unchanged (day 7).
6. **Unknown is not zero**: an incomplete run does not fire a "0% / no movement".
7. **Crossing once per day**: two runs the same day do not both fire (dedupe key
   carries the day).
8. **baseline value 0** raises nothing, only rebaselines (INV-PORTMOVE-004).
9. **Currency change** re-baselines, never compares across currencies
   (INV-PORTMOVE-003).
10. **Percentage precision**: the figure is a ratio, rounded at
    `PORTFOLIO_MOVE_PERCENT_DECIMALS`, never `roundMoney` (a guard scan asserts
    the producer does not `roundMoney` a percentage).
11. **Write door / category wiring / delivery matrix / target route**: the
    `INVESTMENTS` category resolves, the target resolves, one writer.
12. **Rolling-deploy safety**: an absent `valuationComplete` reads as incomplete,
    and a stored row with no `baselineDate`/`valuationDate` falls back whole to
    its stored copy rather than being relabelled.
13. **Flow rate date** (INV-PORTMOVE-007): a deposit on a Saturday folds at
    Saturday's rate on a Monday run, and the resolver is never asked for the run
    day's rate for it; one day's missing rate withholds and names that day.
14. **Late close restates, carried close never blocks** (INV-PORTMOVE-008): a
    close older than the tolerance at the baseline that has since been replaced
    restates the baseline by `quantity x (new - old)` at today's rate and is named
    in the alert; a close inside the tolerance (a feed a session behind) is the
    period's own move; a carried close that is still the latest neither restates
    nor withholds, and the baseline advances (#1435); an unvaluable late close
    rebaselines without firing; a baseline without closes is replaced.

Integration additionally owns the classification itself
(`test/integration/portfolio-movement-flow.integration.spec.ts`): the internal
transfer, the transfer that crossed the boundary and the mixed split, run as real
SQL, plus the per-day conversion over them.

Integration (CI-owned): the baseline write under `withScopedDb`, the
RLS policy, schema drift, the new table's backup round-trip, and a real
`getPortfolioSummary` returning an incomplete valuation (an unpriced security in a
real database).
