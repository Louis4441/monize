# RLS Implementation: Agent Task List

> Companion to [`row-level-security.md`](./row-level-security.md) (the design) and
> [`row-level-security-runbook.md`](./row-level-security-runbook.md) (operations). This file breaks the
> plan into tasks sized for one AI-agent session each. Do the tasks in dependency order; never start a
> task whose dependencies are unmerged. Mark a task done by checking its box and noting the PR.

## How to use this list (read first, every session)

- **One task per session/PR.** Each task lists its files. Touching files outside the task's scope is a
  scope violation — stop and leave a note instead.
- **Every task lands behind `RLS_MODE=off`** and must leave observable behavior at `off` unchanged
  (mechanism may change — see the "Deployment safety" classes below). If your change alters observable
  behavior at `off`, the task is wrong — stop.
- **Definition of done for every task** (in addition to per-task acceptance):
  - `cd backend && npm run build && npm run lint` clean.
  - `npm run test:unit` green; new code covered (95% global / 85% per-file thresholds).
  - Migrations mirrored into `database/schema.sql` in the same PR.
  - No new user-facing strings (RLS is backend-only; if an exception message becomes user-visible, it
    must go through `tr()` + English catalogs, then `npm run i18n:pseudo`).
- **Terminology:** "the design doc" = `row-level-security.md`. Section references (e.g. "Phase 2b")
  point there. Migration numbers below were written when the max was `102_*` and are now stale:
  M1/M2 actually shipped as `111`–`114`. **Verify with `ls database/migrations` and renumber from the
  actual max before writing files.**

## Deployment safety

**Every task except M3 is safe to merge and deploy to existing deployments as soon as it is done, in
any order that respects the dependency column.** Existing deployments stay on `RLS_MODE=off` (the
default; unset env = `off`) throughout; nothing in F/M1/M2/T/R/C/L/D changes their behavior. Behavior
changes only when an operator deliberately flips modes per the runbook. The "Deploy impact" column
uses four classes:

| Class | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **none** | CI, tests, lint, or docs only — or code that ships but nothing calls yet. The running app is byte-for-byte behaviorally identical. |
| **inert** | Ships real code or DB objects to prod, designed to change nothing at `RLS_MODE=off`: a role nothing connects as, policies without `ENABLE`, a GUC-aware trigger that behaves identically while the GUC is unset, context wrappers that only seed ALS. Safe, but verify the per-task acceptance that proves inertness. |
| **neutral** | Rewrites live code paths (the `tenantTx` refactor, the restore swap). Designed behavior-preserving — same queries, same transaction boundaries — but carries normal regression risk. Full unit + module integration/e2e suites are the gate, not optional. |
| **DO NOT DEPLOY** | M3 only. Merging to a branch is fine; deploying it to prod is flip B, an operator decision after flip A has soaked. |

## Task graph

| ID | Task | Depends on | Deploy impact | Status |

| R7 | Refactor: auth, users, delegation, admin, emergency-access, backup, database | F3, C1–C4, C6 | neutral | not started |
| C5 | Backup restore: `preserveTimestamps` flag replaces `DISABLE TRIGGER` DDL | F2, M1, R7 | neutral | blocked (needs M1, R7) |
| L1 | Lint bans: `with-context.ts` import allowlist; `@InjectRepository`/`createQueryRunner` ban | R1–R7 | none | not started |
| D1 | Docs: CLAUDE.md updates (incl. stale scheduler claim), `.env.example` + helm/k8s finalization, runbook promotion prep | all above | none | not started |

**Why context wrapping (C1–C4, C6) comes BEFORE the refactors (R1–R7), not after.** `tenantTx` throws
on missing ambient context in every mode, including `off`. `jwt.strategy` runs in the guard phase —
before the interceptor's ALS scope exists — and `@Cron` handlers have no scope at all. If an R task
converted those code paths to `tenantTx` while the wrapping was still a later task, every login (and
every cron firing) would throw at `RLS_MODE=off` from the moment the R task deployed until the C task
landed — a broken window the old ordering (C depends on R) guaranteed. The fix is directional:
wrapping call paths in `withUserContext`/`withSystemContext` *before* any refactor is **inert** (the
helpers only seed AsyncLocalStorage; repositories keep working), so all wrapping lands first and every
R task converts code whose context already exists. An R task must never convert a call path whose
wrapping has not landed — if one is found mid-task, stop and note it.

Notes on the subtle rows:
- **M1 is a prod DB change on next deploy** (migrations run at startup): it replaces
  `update_updated_at_column()`. Inert because the new function is exactly the old one while
  `app.preserve_timestamps` is unset — and M1's acceptance test proves that. M1 contains **no role or
  grant statements** — a migration referencing `monize_app` would crash-loop any deployment where the
  role does not exist (role and grants are db-init's job, F1).
- **C5 is neutral, not inert:** it swaps the restore mechanism itself. It must work at `RLS_MODE=off`,
  which is why `tenantTx` emits `app.preserve_timestamps` in **every** mode (see F2) and why C5
  requires M1's trigger to already be in the deployed DB (guaranteed: M1 ships earlier and migrations
  run before the app serves traffic).
- **C6 is neutral, not inert:** it moves the interceptor's `touchLastActivity` / timezone-cache calls,
  which today run **before** `requestContextStorage.run()` is entered, into (or under a
  `withUserContext` wrapper matching) the request scope. Behavior-preserving by design, but it edits a
  hot code path on every authenticated request.

Operator-only steps (not agent tasks — see runbook): shadow flip, staging enforce, prod flip A
(privilege drop), prod flip B (deploy M3), monitoring during soaks.

### Open findings from M2's ownership audit — must be closed before flip B

M2 audited how every candidate table is actually keyed at its call sites (rather than trusting the
design doc's lists). That audit surfaced three call paths that **no policy can fix** — they will
return zero rows under enforcement because the ambient context does not name the right user. They are
context-wrapping bugs, out of M2's file scope, and are recorded here rather than papered over with a
policy arm. None of them affects anything today (`RLS_MODE=off`, policies not enabled).

1. **`delegation.service.ts` `delegateMustEnrollOwn2FA` reads the *owner's* `user_preferences` under
   `withUserContext(delegate)`.** Reached from `jwt.strategy`'s `validateActingContext`, i.e. on
   **every delegate-token request**. `withUserContext(sub)` seeds only `userId`, so both GUCs collapse
   to the delegate and the owner's preferences row matches neither arm. The fix belongs with the
   delegation wrapping work: seed **both** identities (current = owner, real = delegate) for delegate
   tokens instead of a single-id context. Blocks R7 as well as flip B.
2. **`AccountDelegateGuard` needs the same two-GUC seeding** — already flagged in C1 as out of its
   scope, repeated here because it has the same root cause and the same fix. It must land **before**
   R2/R7 convert `DelegationService` to `tenantTx`, or delegate requests throw at `off`.
3. **`backend/src/admin/` contains no `withSystemContext` at all.** Admin cross-user writes to
   `refresh_tokens`, `personal_access_tokens` and `user_preferences` run under the admin's own user
   context and would silently affect zero rows under enforcement. The design doc (Phase 4) assumes
   admin is wrapped; no task currently owns it. R7 lists the admin module but R-task rules forbid
   adding new wrapping — this needs its own C-task (or an explicit extension of R7's scope).

A fourth, milder case is already covered by policy and needs no follow-up:
`users.service.ts` deleting refresh tokens by `actingAsUserId` works because M2 gave
`refresh_tokens` an `acting_as_user_id = current` arm.

## Foundation tasks

### F1. RLS_MODE flag, role creation, env plumbing

- [x] Status: done (branch `claude/rls-foundation-tasks-s8vgu4`)

**Scope:** `backend/src/db-init.ts`, `backend/src/app.module.ts`, `.env.example`, all
`docker-compose*.yml`, `helm/values.yaml`, `helm/templates/configmap-backend.yaml` (+ document the
CNPG `managed.roles` requirement and the kustomize-overlay ConfigMap/Secret keys).

**Do:**
1. `db-init.ts`: role **and grants** per design Phase 1, running on every startup **before the
   existing "tables already exist" early return** (`db-init.ts:44-56` — placed after it, the logic
   never runs on an initialized DB and rotation silently breaks):
   - When `DATABASE_APP_PASSWORD` is set: create/rotate `monize_app` — password via **parameterized**
     `set_config('monize.app_password', $1, false)`, then the `DO $$` block from the design doc
     (CREATE if absent, ALTER PASSWORD if present). Catch `insufficient_privilege` (42501) and
     continue with a warning naming CNPG `managed.roles` as the provisioning path. If unset, skip
     with a logged warning.
   - Whenever the role **exists** (however provisioned): idempotently apply the DML grants and
     `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` (**no `FOR ROLE` clause** — the owner-role name is operator-chosen;
     see design Phase 1). **No migration may contain a role or grant statement.**
2. `app.module.ts` TypeORM factory: read `RLS_MODE` (`off`|`shadow`|`enforce`, default `off`); at
   `enforce` connect as `DATABASE_APP_USER`/`DATABASE_APP_PASSWORD`, else `DATABASE_USER`. Startup
   validation: `enforce` without `DATABASE_APP_PASSWORD` refuses to boot with a clear error. Invalid
   `RLS_MODE` value also refuses to boot. Expose the parsed mode via a small config provider (F2's
   `tenantTx` reads it).
3. Env: add `RLS_MODE`, `DATABASE_APP_USER`, `DATABASE_APP_PASSWORD` to `.env.example` (documented,
   including the `log_statement` password-visibility caveat) and to every `docker-compose*.yml` with
   empty-safe defaults (`${DATABASE_APP_PASSWORD:-}`); add the same keys to the helm chart
   (ConfigMap for mode/user, existing DB Secret for the password).

**Accept:** unit tests for mode parsing/validation (all 3 valid values, invalid value, enforce-without-
password). `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up` boots unchanged with an untouched `.env`
(no `DATABASE_APP_PASSWORD`): fresh init succeeds and no role is created. With the var set: role
exists with grants after boot; changing the var and restarting rotates the password **on an
already-initialized DB** (proves placement before the early return); revoking a grant and restarting
restores it (proves idempotent re-apply). No pool-size configuration added.

### F2. Request context extension + `tenantTx` + `with-context` helpers

- [x] Status: done (branch `claude/rls-foundation-tasks-s8vgu4`)

**Scope:** `backend/src/common/request-context.ts`, new `backend/src/common/db/tenant-tx.ts`, new
`backend/src/common/db/with-context.ts`, their unit tests. **Do not refactor any service in this task.**

**Do:**
1. Extend `RequestContext` with `realUserId?: string; system?: boolean; preserveTimestamps?: boolean`.
   No `qr` field — the design has no pinned connection.
2. `tenantTx(dataSource, fn)` exactly per design Phase 2b: throw
   `"DB access outside request/user/system context -- wrap the call path in withUserContext/withSystemContext"`
   when no ambient `userId`/`system`. **Re-entrancy first:** if the ALS scope already carries an active
   `EntityManager`, call `fn` with it directly — join the ambient transaction, never open a second one
   (a nested `dataSource.transaction` takes a second pooled connection and deadlocks the pool under
   load; see design Phase 2b). Otherwise open `dataSource.transaction`; when mode is not `off`, first
   emit `set_config('app.bypass_rls', 'on', true)` (system) or **both**
   `set_config('app.current_user_id', $1, true)` and
   `set_config('app.real_user_id', $1, true)` (user; real defaults to `ctx.realUserId ?? ctx.userId`);
   record the manager in the ALS scope; then run `fn(m)`. Additionally emit
   `set_config('app.preserve_timestamps', 'on', true)` whenever the context flag is set — **in every
   mode, including `off`, NOT gated on `RLS_MODE`**: it functionally replaces the restore path's
   `DISABLE TRIGGER` DDL (C5 breaks at `off` if this is mode-gated). All emissions transaction-local
   (`true` third arg) — never `false`.
3. `withUserContext(userId, fn)` / `withSystemContext(fn)`: seed the ALS scope (`{ userId }` /
   `{ system: true }`) and run `fn`. `withUserContext` validates `userId` is a UUID (a garbage value
   would make every policied statement raise 22P02). No connection handling, no cleanup.
   `withSystemContext` logs each invocation with its call site, rate-limited.
4. `RequestContextInterceptor` seeds `{ userId, realUserId, timezone }` for all authenticated routes
   (delegation already resolved by `jwt.strategy`; `realUserId` from `req.user.realUserId`). Do NOT
   move the fire-and-forget calls in this task — that is C6.
5. `GlobalExceptionFilter`: map Postgres `new row violates row-level security policy` (and the 22P02
   helper-cast error) to a generic 403/404 — these must never surface raw to users (design Phase 6
   i18n note).

**Accept:** unit tests assert — exact `set_config(..., true)` SQL per branch including both identity
GUCs and the `realUserId ?? userId` default; throw on missing context in every mode including `off`;
**nested `tenantTx` reuses the ambient manager and opens no second transaction**; no **identity**-GUC
emission at `off`; `preserveTimestamps` emission in **every** mode including `off`; system-vs-user
branch selection; UUID validation in `withUserContext`; filter mapping. LSP diagnostics clean.

### F3. CI ratchet

- [x] Status: done (branch `claude/rls-foundation-tasks-s8vgu4`). Baselines measured
  at implementation time: **251** `@InjectRepository(` call sites, **61**
  `createQueryRunner(` call sites (script counts occurrences, not files). Script:
  `backend/scripts/rls-ratchet.mjs` (+ `--update`), self-test
  `rls-ratchet.test.mjs`, committed baseline `rls-ratchet-baseline.json`; wired
  into the `backend-lint` CI job (`npm run rls:ratchet:test` then
  `npm run rls:ratchet`). Exact-match ratchet: a count above baseline fails
  (banned new site), below baseline fails (lower the baseline in the same PR).

**Scope:** a script under `backend/scripts/` (or repo `scripts/`), CI workflow wiring, a committed
baseline file.

**Do:** count `@InjectRepository(` and `createQueryRunner(` occurrences in `backend/src` (exclude
`tenant-tx.ts`, tests, test helpers). Fail CI if either count exceeds the committed baseline; passing
runs update instructions tell the agent to lower the baseline in the same PR as a refactor. Baselines
start at current counts (measured 2026-07: 86 files with `@InjectRepository` / 61 `createQueryRunner`
call sites — script counts call sites, measure
at implementation time).

**Accept:** script runs in CI; artificially adding one `@InjectRepository` fails it; lowering baseline
below actual also fails (prevents over-claiming).

## Migration tasks

### M1. Helper functions + GUC-aware trigger (no grants)

- [x] Status: done (branch `claude/rls-migration-m1-m2-gyj3w6`). Shipped as
  `database/migrations/111_rls_helpers_and_trigger.sql` (actual max at authoring time was `110`,
  not the `102` the plan assumed), mirrored into `database/schema.sql`. Acceptance spec:
  `backend/test/integration/rls-helpers-and-trigger.integration.spec.ts` (11 tests), which executes
  the migration file **read from disk** so it cannot drift from what ships.

  **One deliberate deviation from the design doc's SQL.** `app_bypass_rls()` is
  `COALESCE(current_setting('app.bypass_rls', true) = 'on', false)`, not the doc's bare comparison.
  With the GUC unset the bare form returns **NULL**, not `false`. In the OR-ed policy predicates
  that is still fail-closed (`false OR NULL` is NULL, so the row is filtered out — verified), but a
  boolean helper that can return NULL is a trap for any future caller writing `NOT app_bypass_rls()`,
  which would also be NULL and silently match nothing. `app_current_user_id()` /
  `app_real_user_id()` keep returning NULL by design — that is what makes the policies deny.

  **Verified against a real PostgreSQL 16** (not just review): applies and re-applies cleanly on a
  fresh `schema.sql` install *and* on the pre-M1 schema; **no `monize_app` role existed in the
  cluster** for either run; helpers return NULL/false unset, read both GUCs independently, revert at
  COMMIT on the same physical connection, treat empty string as unset, and raise 22P02 (not zero
  rows) on a non-UUID value; the `updated_at` trigger stamps `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` exactly as before
  while `app.preserve_timestamps` is unset, preserves the supplied value when it is `'on'`, and
  resumes stamping after that transaction commits.

**Scope:** new `database/migrations/103_rls_helpers_and_trigger.sql` (renumber from actual max),
`database/schema.sql`.

**Do:** per design Phase 3 — `app_current_user_id()`, `app_real_user_id()`, and `app_bypass_rls()`
helper functions; `CREATE OR REPLACE` of `update_updated_at_column()` with the
`app.preserve_timestamps` check. Idempotent. Behavior-inert (no policy, no enable).
**This migration must contain NO role or grant statements** — `GRANT ... TO monize_app` in a
migration crash-loops every deployment where the role does not exist (role + grants are db-init's
job, F1). Reject the task if any SQL here mentions `monize_app` or an owner-role name.

**Accept:** migration applies cleanly on a fresh dev DB **with and without `DATABASE_APP_PASSWORD`
set** and re-applies idempotently; `updated_at` trigger behavior unchanged when the GUC is unset
(add/extend a unit or integration test); schema.sql mirrored; `grep -i 'grant\|role' 103_*.sql`
returns nothing.

### M2. Policy migrations (direct, indirect, special) — no enable

- [x] Status: done (branch `claude/rls-migration-m1-m2-gyj3w6`). Shipped as
  `112_rls_policies_direct.sql`, `113_rls_policies_indirect.sql`, `114_rls_policies_special.sql`,
  all mirrored into `database/schema.sql`. **50 policies over 54 tables** (4 exempt), one policy per
  table, no `ENABLE`, no role or grant statement anywhere.

  **The design doc's table lists were re-derived from `schema.sql`, as the task instructed — and
  they had drifted.** Final buckets:

  | Bucket | Count | Change vs. design doc |
  |--------|-------|------------------------|
  | Direct, effective-user keyed (`user_id = current`) | 26 | — |
  | Direct, **authenticated**-user keyed (`current OR real`) | 4 | **new sub-bucket** (see below) |
  | Indirect (`EXISTS` to parent) | 15 | +1: `attachment_blobs` |
  | Special (bespoke owner columns) | 5 | — |
  | Exempt | 4 | — |

  - `transaction_attachments` (direct) and `attachment_blobs` (indirect → `transaction_attachments`)
    postdate the design doc (migration 109) and were missing from every list in it.
  - **Four tables the doc filed under a uniform `user_id = current` policy are keyed by the
    *authenticated* user, not the effective one**, so that policy would have returned zero rows for
    an acting delegate — inside normal request scope, where nothing throws and nothing logs. Each was
    confirmed at the call sites, not assumed: `refresh_tokens` (entity comment and
    `token.service.ts` are explicit that `user_id` is always the real user, with the owner in
    `acting_as_user_id`; `POST /auth/switch-context` is `@AllowDelegate` and both revokes and inserts
    delegate-keyed rows), `trusted_devices` (every authenticated route passes `req.user.realUserId`
    and those routes *are* `@AllowDelegate`), `user_preferences` (mostly effective-keyed, but the
    three `@AllowDelegate` 2FA endpoints read/write the delegate's own row), and
    `personal_access_tokens` (real-keyed in effect — `PatController` has no `@AllowDelegate`, so the
    two ids coincide today; the real arm makes adding one later a non-event instead of a silent
    zero-rows bug). These get `user_id = current OR user_id = real`. The arm cannot widen isolation:
    `app.real_user_id` only ever holds the id the JWT layer authenticated, so it exposes the caller's
    own rows and never a third party's.
  - `refresh_tokens` also gets an `acting_as_user_id = current` arm so that an owner deleting their
    account still purges the delegate sessions opened against their data (`users.service.ts` deletes
    by `actingAsUserId`; those rows carry another user's `user_id` and would otherwise be invisible,
    leaving live sessions pointing at deleted data).
  - **`currencies` exemption rationale corrected.** The doc justified it as having "no owner"; it
    does have `created_by_user_id`. It stays exempt for a better reason, now documented in the
    migration: that column is attribution (NULL = system currency), not ownership — any user may
    reference a custom code through `accounts.currency_code`, and a `created_by_user_id` policy would
    hide every system currency and break those foreign keys. Per-user visibility is already carried
    by `user_currency_preferences`, which *is* policied.
  - Junction tables are scoped through their **owning parent only**, not both FKs — matching the
    indirect-ownership map shape T2 expects. Rationale in `113`: the owning-side predicate is what
    enforces isolation, and the residual case (linking one's own row to another user's tag) exposes
    nothing readable, since the tag row is protected by the `tags` policy.

  **Verified under actual enforcement, not just by review.** The policies are inert as shipped, so
  correctness was proved in a scratch PostgreSQL 16 database by enabling RLS on all 50 policied
  tables, creating a non-owner `monize_app` role with the F1 grants, and seeding an owner, a
  delegate, and an unrelated third user: no GUC → zero rows on direct *and* indirect tables; per-user
  GUC → only that user's rows; `WITH CHECK` rejects a cross-user INSERT and a UPDATE that reassigns
  `user_id`, on both direct and indirect tables; a cross-user UPDATE affects 0 rows; a non-UUID GUC
  raises 22P02; `app.bypass_rls` sees everything; the app role cannot `ALTER TABLE ... DISABLE ROW
  LEVEL SECURITY` or `DROP POLICY` (`must be owner of table`). Delegation, all four cases: acting
  (current=owner, real=delegate) sees the owner's accounts/transactions, both `users` rows, the
  delegation from both sides, its grants, and its own favourites/devices/refresh tokens; the delegate
  can INSERT a favourite while acting; the **owner alone cannot see the delegate's private
  favourites or trusted devices**; the delegate in their own session sees none of the owner's data
  but still sees the delegation row. Removing the `real` arm from any of the three special policies
  breaks the corresponding case.

  **Zero schema drift:** a fresh `schema.sql` install and a pre-RLS schema + migrations 111–114 were
  diffed on `pg_policies` (qual + with_check text) and on `pg_get_functiondef` for all four
  functions — identical.

  **T2 note:** the four-bucket map in the catalog spec must include the new authenticated-user
  sub-bucket and `attachment_blobs`, or it will fail against these migrations.

**Scope:** new `database/migrations/104_rls_policies_direct.sql`, `105_rls_policies_indirect.sql`,
`106_rls_policies_special.sql`, `database/schema.sql`.

**Do:** per design Phase 3. Every policy in the `(SELECT app_current_user_id())` initplan form with the
`OR (SELECT app_bypass_rls())` escape. **Enumerate every table's owner column from
`database/schema.sql` — do not trust any list, including the design doc's** (an earlier draft listed
tables under `user_id` policies that have no such column; `CREATE POLICY` validates its expression, so
a wrong column name crash-loops the deploy):
- **Direct** (`user_id`): the 29 tables verified in the design doc.
- **Indirect** (`EXISTS` to parent): `holdings`, `transaction_splits`, `transaction_tags`,
  `transaction_split_tags` (two-hop), `security_tags`, `security_prices`,
  `scheduled_transaction_splits`, `scheduled_transaction_split_tags` (two-hop),
  `scheduled_transaction_overrides`, `monte_carlo_cash_flows`, `budget_categories`, `budget_periods`,
  `budget_period_categories` (two-hop), `account_delegate_grants`.
- **Special** (bespoke owner columns, both GUCs — design Phase 3): `users`
  (`id = current OR id = real`), `account_delegates` (`owner_user_id = current OR
  delegate_user_id = real`), `delegate_account_favourites` (`delegate_user_id = real`),
  `emergency_access_settings` / `emergency_access_contacts` (`owner_user_id = current`).
`DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` before each `CREATE`. `currencies`, `exchange_rates`, `oauth_payloads`,
`schema_migrations` deliberately excluded — say so, with rationale, in a comment.
**No `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` and no role/grant statements anywhere in these files.**

**Accept:** migrations apply + re-apply cleanly **on a DB without the `monize_app` role**;
`SELECT count(*) FROM pg_policies` matches the enumerated table count; every policied table's owner
column verified against schema.sql in the PR description; app behavior unchanged (policies inert
without enable); schema.sql mirrored.

### M3. Enable migration — authored, not deployed

- [ ] Status: not started. **Renumber: M2 ended at `114`, so this is `115_rls_enable.sql`.** The
  exact target list is the 50 tables policied by migrations `112`–`114`; derive it from
  `SELECT DISTINCT tablename FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public'` rather than retyping it.
  M2 already dry-ran this enable in a scratch database and verified every policy behaves correctly
  under it (see M2's status note), so M3 is expected to be mechanical.

**Scope:** new `database/migrations/107_rls_enable.sql`, `database/schema.sql`.

**Do:** `ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` for exactly the tables policied in M2. **This file
is flip B.** It ships to prod only in its own release after flip A soaks (runbook). Land it on a branch
CI can validate but tag the PR clearly: `do-not-deploy-before-flip-A`.

**Accept:** applies cleanly in a scratch DB; `pg_class.relrowsecurity` true for every policied table;
integration suite (T2) passes against it.

## Test tasks

### T1. Integration harness applies real migrations

- [ ] Status: not started

**Scope:** `backend/test/helpers/integration-setup.ts` (+ a new helper file if cleaner).

**Do:** after `synchronize`, run `applyRlsPolicies(dataSource)`:
1. Create `monize_app` in the test DB **before** anything references it, and apply the F1 grants
   (reuse/share db-init's grant SQL — the migrations no longer contain grants).
2. Execute the actual `database/migrations/1NN_rls_*.sql` files read from disk (never duplicated SQL).
3. Create the `update_updated_at_column()` **triggers** for the tables the trigger tests touch,
   extracting their `CREATE TRIGGER` DDL from `database/schema.sql` — `synchronize` builds from
   entities and creates **no** DB triggers (`@UpdateDateColumn` stamps app-side), and the RLS
   migrations only replace the trigger *function*. Without this step, T2's trigger assertions and
   C5's restore acceptance pass vacuously.
Keep existing suites green — notably `security-cross-user-isolation.integration.spec.ts`.

**Accept:** all existing integration suites pass; harness fails loudly if a migration file is missing
or unreadable (no silent skip); a raw `UPDATE` on a trigger-covered table in the test DB stamps
`updated_at` (proves the triggers actually exist in the harness).

### T2. Catalog-driven `rls-enforcement` spec

- [ ] Status: not started

**Scope:** new `backend/test/integration/rls-enforcement.integration.spec.ts`.

**Do:** per design Phase 5. Enumerate every table from the DB; each must be in exactly one of **four**
buckets — `user_id` column / explicit **owner-column map** (`users → id`,
`account_delegates → owner_user_id + delegate_user_id`, `delegate_account_favourites →
delegate_user_id`, `emergency_access_settings|contacts → owner_user_id`) / explicit
indirect-ownership map / explicit exemption list (`currencies`, `exchange_rates`, `oauth_payloads`,
`schema_migrations`) — anything else **fails**. Missing `pg_policies` entry for a bucketed table
fails. Then, per covered table, inside a transaction with `SET LOCAL ROLE monize_app`: userA/userB
visibility; unset/empty GUC → **zero rows**; **non-UUID garbage GUC → the statement raises
`invalid input syntax for type uuid` (22P02), asserted as an error, not as empty results**;
`WITH CHECK` cross-user insert rejection; `app.bypass_rls` cross-user read;
`app.preserve_timestamps` trigger behavior; **delegation semantics** — with `current` = owner and
`real` = delegate: the delegate's `users` row is visible, `delegate_account_favourites` rows are
visible and insertable, `account_delegates` visible from both sides; and the **GUC scope test** —
after a committed `tenantTx`, `current_setting('app.current_user_id', true)` on the same connection
is empty and a raw `SELECT` returns zero rows.

**Accept:** suite green against M1–M3; deliberately dropping one policy in a scratch run makes it fail;
adding a fake unbucketed table makes it fail; the delegation assertions fail if the `real` GUC arm is
removed from any of the three special policies.

---

## Service refactor tasks (R1–R7)

Shared instructions for every R task — the per-task list only names the modules:

- Replace injected-repository data access with `tenantTx(this.dataSource, (m) => ...)`; replace manual
  `createQueryRunner()`/`startTransaction()`/`release()` blocks with
  `tenantTx(this.dataSource, async (m) => { ... })`. Helpers that took a `QueryRunner` take an
  `EntityManager`. Scope each `tenantTx` to the unit the code transacts **today** — one read or one
  read-modify-write block; never a whole request handler. Cross-service calls need no special
  handling: a nested `tenantTx` joins the ambient transaction (F2's re-entrancy).
- **Context precondition:** C1–C4 and C6 have already wrapped every out-of-request entry point
  (guards/strategies, crons, seeders, interceptor writes) — an R task only converts data access whose
  ambient context exists. If you find a call path reaching the module's services with no wrapping
  (`tenantTx` would throw at `off`), **stop and note it** — do not add `withSystemContext` yourself
  and do not convert that path.
- Keep the existing per-module unit tests green by mocking `tenantTx`/`DataSource.transaction` instead
  of repositories; update test helpers once, reuse across the batch.
- Lower the F3 ratchet baselines in the same PR.
- Out of scope: any *new* `withSystemContext`/`withUserContext` wrapping, any module not listed.
- Accept (every R task): build/lint/unit green; module's integration + e2e specs green; **a dev smoke
  of the module's cron/bootstrap paths at `RLS_MODE=off` shows no context throws**; ratchet lowered;
  zero `@InjectRepository`/`createQueryRunner` left in the listed modules.

### R1. accounts, categories, payees, tags, institutions
- [x] Status: done (branch `claude/row-level-security-r1-d6onbm`). All 13 service files converted
  (accounts ×8, categories, payees ×2 + `insert-payee-alias.util`, tags, institutions); ratchet
  lowered **251 → 214** `@InjectRepository` / **61 → 47** `createQueryRunner` (−51 sites, zero left
  in the five modules). Raw SQL (balance updates, daily balances, statement figures, forecast,
  favourite reorder, the due-balance cron's bulk UPDATE) stayed raw and moved inside `tenantTx`
  (`m.query`). Full `npm run test:unit` green (9153), build + lint clean.

  **Boundary decisions (for R2/R6 and L1):**
  - Helpers still called from unrefactored modules **keep their optional `queryRunner` parameter**
    with today's semantics; only the no-runner fallback became `tenantTx`:
    `TagsService.setTransactionTags/setSplitTags/+Bulk` (callers: transactions, R2) and
    `AccountsService.updateBalance/recalculateCurrentBalance` (callers: transactions/securities/
    import). After R2 converts those callers, the parameters can be dropped -- a nested `tenantTx`
    joins the ambient transaction. `insertPayeeAliasIgnoringDuplicate` and the auto-merge private
    helpers now take an `EntityManager` (all callers in-module);
    `PayeesService.findPayeeByAlias` dropped its never-passed `queryRunner` param.
  - **`getUsersByEffectiveTimezone` (`common/users-by-timezone.util.ts`) still queries the
    DataSource directly** -- it is shared by other modules' crons (budgets, scheduled-transactions,
    notifications), so converting it belongs with a later R task; the accounts cron's own reads and
    the bulk UPDATE do run through `tenantTx` (one transaction per timezone bucket).
  - Module files keep their `TypeOrmModule.forFeature` registrations (inert unused providers);
    dropping them can ride along with L1.

  **Tests:** shared harness `backend/src/test-helpers/tenant-tx-testing.ts` (+ its own spec):
  specs `jest.mock` the tenant-tx module so `tenantTx(ds, fn)` delegates to the mock
  `dataSource.transaction`, and `manager.getRepository(Entity)` routes to the same per-entity
  repository mocks the specs already assert against (the directory is excluded from the F3 ratchet
  by its existing `test-helpers/` rule). The cron/bootstrap smoke is encoded as
  `src/accounts/rls-context-smoke.spec.ts`, which runs the two accounts crons under the **real**
  `tenantTx` + C2 wrappers at `RLS_MODE=off` (plus a negative control proving an unwrapped call
  still throws), so the no-context-throw acceptance is CI-checked rather than a one-off dev run.

### R2. transactions, scheduled-transactions
- [x] Status: done (branch `claude/row-level-security-r1-d6onbm`). All 9 service files converted
  (transactions ×6: `transactions`, `transaction-split`, `transaction-transfer`,
  `transaction-bulk-update`, `transaction-reconciliation`, `transaction-analytics`;
  scheduled-transactions ×3: `scheduled-transactions`, `scheduled-transaction-loan`,
  `scheduled-transaction-override`). Ratchet lowered **214 → 187** `@InjectRepository` /
  **47 → 31** `createQueryRunner` (−43 sites, zero left in the two modules). Full
  `npm run test:unit` green (9154), build + lint + `i18n:check` clean.

  **Transaction boundaries preserved exactly.** Each former `createQueryRunner()` block became one
  `tenantTx`; each former autocommit read became its own short `tenantTx`. So `removeTransfer` /
  `updateTransfer` legitimately open **two** transactions (the split-parent lookup, then the write
  block) — matching what they did pre-RLS, not a regression. Two boundaries that needed care:
  - `findAll` wraps its whole read block in a single `tenantTx` and threads the `EntityManager`
    through every helper (`calculateStartingBalance`, `buildFilteredIdsSubquery`,
    `computeSplitAwareSum`, `enrichWithInvestmentLinks`, …), so the page query, its balance
    sub-queries and the attachment-count roll-up share one snapshot as before.
  - The auto-post cron's per-timezone read `tenantTx` **must commit before** the per-user posting
    loop: each `post()` runs its own `withUserContext` transactions, which would otherwise join the
    system-context one via F2 re-entrancy.

  **Boundary decisions (for R3/R6 and L1):**
  - The R1 helpers that kept an optional `queryRunner` for unrefactored callers **dropped it**:
    `TagsService.setTransactionTags/setSplitTags/+Bulk` and
    `AccountsService.updateBalance/recalculateCurrentBalance` are now called with no runner from
    both modules — a nested `tenantTx` joins the ambient transaction. Same for the in-module
    helpers: `TransactionSplitService.createSplits`/`deleteSplitSideEffects` lost their
    `externalQueryRunner` parameter, and `applySplitTags`/`removeParentTransaction`/
    `ScheduledTransactionsService.createSplits` take an `EntityManager` (or nothing) instead.
  - `InvestmentTransactionsService.createEmbeddedForSplit` / `reverseAndRemoveEmbedded` accept
    `QueryRunner | EntityManager` for now (a two-line shim at the top of each): the split service
    passes an `EntityManager` while securities-internal callers still pass a `QueryRunner`. **R3
    should delete the shim** once those callers convert.
  - `TransactionSplitService.deleteTransferSplitLinkedTransactions` was **removed** — dead
    production code (a strict subset of `deleteSplitSideEffects`, which handles investment splits
    too); its specs were re-pointed at `deleteSplitSideEffects`, so the transfer-leg reversal
    coverage is unchanged.
  - `getUsersByEffectiveTimezone` still queries the DataSource directly (unchanged from R1).

  **Tests:** the R1 harness (`src/test-helpers/tenant-tx-testing.ts`) carried the whole batch — the
  specs `jest.mock` the tenant-tx module and route `manager.getRepository(Entity)` to the same
  per-entity mocks. Where a spec previously distinguished "injected repo" from "queryRunner.manager"
  (bulk-update, transactions), those now resolve to one mock, so the per-phase overrides collapsed
  into a single ordered `createQueryBuilder` chain. QueryRunner-lifecycle assertions
  (`commitTransaction`/`release`) became `dataSource.transaction` grouping assertions. The
  cron smoke is `src/scheduled-transactions/rls-context-smoke.spec.ts`, which runs the auto-post
  cron end to end under the **real** `tenantTx` + C2 wrappers at `RLS_MODE=off` (plus a negative
  control proving an unwrapped call still throws).

### R3. securities, investment-reports, net-worth, monte-carlo, loan-rate-changes, loan-scenarios
- [ ] Status: not started — ~14 service files; includes holdings rebuild and investment CRUD
  QueryRunner flows.

### R4. budgets
- [ ] Status: not started — ~8 service files.

### R5. built-in-reports, reports
- [ ] Status: not started — ~10 service files; read-heavy — watch that report queries stay
  single-`tenantTx` (no per-row transactions in loops).

### R6. ai, mcp, import, action-history, currencies, updates, notifications
- [ ] Status: not started — ~12 service files. AI relay/query SSE and MCP HTTP must hold **no**
  connection between queries (verify streaming paths call `tenantTx` per operation, not around the
  stream).

### R7. auth, users, delegation, admin, emergency-access, backup, database
- [ ] Status: not started — ~15 service files. The context wrapping for these modules already landed
  in C1/C3/C4 (this is why R7 depends on them) — the refactor converts data access *inside* those
  existing scopes. Delegation paths keyed by `realUserId` (`changePassword`,
  `delegate_account_favourites`) need no special handling: the context carries `realUserId` and the
  special policies match it. Restore's `preserveTimestamps` swap stays out of scope (C5).

## Context-wrapping tasks (C1–C6)

### C1. Auth wrapping + public-route audit (lands BEFORE the refactors)

- [x] Status: done (branch `claude/rls-task-status-column-8qqlbm`). Wrapping applied:
  `jwt.strategy.validate` runs both lookups under `withUserContext(payload.sub)`;
  `AuthService.{register,login,refreshTokens,verify2FA,findOrCreateOidcUser,confirmOidcLink,generateResetToken,resetPassword,generateVerificationToken,verifyEmail}`
  under `withSystemContext` (the large bodies extracted to `*WithinContext` privates to keep the
  wrapper a one-liner); `PatService.validateToken` under `withSystemContext`; the two shared methods
  reachable on public routes wrapped at their call sites (`generateTokenPair` in the OIDC callback,
  `revokeRefreshToken` in `logout`, both `withSystemContext`); `OAuthProviderService.findAccount` and
  `validateAccessToken` read `getUserStateById` under `withUserContext(sub)`;
  `OAuthInteractionController.resolveCookieUser` reads `getUserById` under
  `withUserContext(payload.sub)`. Context-assertion unit tests added to the jwt.strategy, auth.service,
  pat.service, oauth-provider, and oauth-interaction specs; existing specs updated to UUID fixtures
  (jwt/OAuth subs now flow through `withUserContext`'s UUID validation). Full `npm run test:unit` green
  (8917), build + lint clean, F3 ratchet unchanged.

**Public-route audit (findings):**
- **Wrapped in C1 (touch user tables, no `req.user`):** every public `auth.controller` route
  (`register`, `login`, `oidc/callback`, `forgot/reset-password`, `verify/resend-verification`,
  `2fa/verify`, `refresh`, `oidc/confirm-link`, `logout`) via the `AuthService` / call-site wraps
  above; PAT auth (`PatService.validateToken`) and OAuth access-token auth
  (`OAuthProviderService.validateAccessToken`), both entered from `mcp-http.controller`'s
  `validatePat` (that controller is R6's file scope — wrapping the two services it calls covers the
  auth phase); the node-oidc-provider Express mount's one user-table touch (`findAccount`); the OAuth
  consent pages (`oauth-interaction.controller`).
- **`jwt.strategy` uses `withUserContext`, never `withSystemContext`** (verified by grep + a unit
  test) — it is the highest-QPS query in the system, so bypass must never be its steady state.
- **Exempt (no user data — note only):** `health.controller` (`SELECT 1` connectivity probe only);
  `oauth-metadata.controller` and the OIDC discovery documents (static config); the node-oidc-provider
  Express mount's `oauth_payloads` reads/writes (that table is deliberately **RLS-exempt**, see M2).
- **`oauth_payloads` hardening decision:** keep the `monize_app` DML grants and leave the table
  RLS-exempt (matches M2's exclusion list) — no owner-DataSource split. `oauth_payloads` is a
  short-lived opaque token/grant store keyed by random id, never queried per end-user, so an owner
  policy would add no isolation.
- **Flagged, NOT wrapped (out of C1's file scope):**
  - `AccountDelegateGuard` (`backend/src/delegation/guards/account-delegate.guard.ts`) runs in the
    guard phase *before* `AuthGuard('jwt')` and, **for delegate tokens only**, calls
    `DelegationService` methods that read `account_delegates` / `account_delegate_grants` / `accounts`
    / `transactions` / `scheduled_transactions`. It knows the identity (it verifies the token itself:
    `payload.sub` = delegate, `payload.actingAsUserId` = owner), but correct wrapping needs **both**
    GUCs (`current` = owner, `real` = delegate), which `withUserContext(userId)` alone cannot seed. It
    lives in the delegation module (outside C1's `auth/**` + `oauth/**` scope), so it is left for the
    delegation wrapping/refactor — **must land before R2/R7 convert `DelegationService` to
    `tenantTx`**, or delegate requests throw at `off`.
  - `emergency-access-claim.controller` public routes → **C4**.
  - `RequestContextInterceptor`'s `touchLastActivity` / timezone reads run outside its own scope →
    **C6**.
- **L1 note:** the `with-context.ts` import allowlist must include `backend/src/oauth/**` (this task
  added `withUserContext` imports to `oauth-provider.service.ts` and `oauth-interaction.controller.ts`)
  in addition to the auth module.

**Scope:** `backend/src/auth/**`, `backend/src/oauth/**`, PAT validation path, password-reset +
email-verification lookups, plus the audit. Wrapping only — no repository-to-`tenantTx` conversion
(that is R7). Wrapping before refactoring is inert: the helpers only seed ALS.

**Do:** per design Phase 4:
- `jwt.strategy` validate (user + delegation lookups): **`withUserContext(payload.sub)`**, NOT
  `withSystemContext` — the verified token already names the user, and this is the highest-QPS query
  in the system; bypass must not be its steady state.
- `withSystemContext` for the genuinely pre-identity paths: login-by-email / register / refresh, PAT
  token-hash lookup (all MCP traffic), password-reset / email-verification token lookups, OIDC/OAuth
  callback and the MCP-connector OAuth flow's `oauth_payloads` access. While here, record the
  `oauth_payloads` hardening decision (design Phase 3: keep grants + RLS-exempt, or revoke
  `monize_app` grants and use an owner DataSource for the OAuth module) in the PR.
- Then **audit every route reachable without `req.user`** (guard-less controllers, public decorators,
  every Passport strategy) and list the findings in the PR — each either wrapped, or explicitly
  justified as touching no user table.

**Accept:** integration/e2e auth suites green (wrapping is behavior-neutral pre-refactor); audit list
in PR description; grep shows no `withSystemContext` import in `jwt.strategy`.

### C2. Cron jobs

- [x] Status: done (branch `claude/rls-task-status-column-8qqlbm`). All 20 `@Cron` decorators
  enumerated; the two demo-reset crons are C3's scope and the emergency-access expiry monitor is C4's,
  leaving 17 wrapped here. Auto-post wrapper-usage test added
  (`scheduled-transactions.service.spec.ts`) asserting the fan-out runs under `{ system: true }` and
  each `post()` under `{ userId }`. Non-UUID user-id fixtures across the touched cron specs moved to
  UUIDs (the per-user wrap validates the id). Full `npm run test:unit` green (8921), build + lint
  clean, F3 ratchet unchanged.

  **Per-handler wrapping (17 of 20; demo-reset ×2 → C3, emergency-access-monitor → C4):**

  | Handler | File | Wrapping |
  |---------|------|----------|
  | `purgeOldUsageLogs` | `ai/ai-usage.service.ts` | system (bulk delete) |
  | `handleDailyInsightGeneration` | `ai/insights/ai-insights.service.ts` | system (cleanup + active-user fan-out) + `withUserContext` per `generateInsights` |
  | `purgeExpiredRefreshTokens` | `auth/token.service.ts` | system (bulk delete) |
  | `scheduledPriceRefresh` | `securities/security-price.service.ts` | system (symbol-grouped refresh + snapshot recalc, irreducibly cross-user) |
  | `applyMaturedInvestmentHoldings` | `securities/holdings.service.ts` | system (tz + matured-user fan-out) + `withUserContext` per `rebuildFromTransactions` |
  | `scheduledRefresh` | `updates/updates.service.ts` | **none** — no DB access (GitHub fetch + in-memory cache) |
  | `cleanupExpiredHistory` | `action-history/action-history.service.ts` | system (bulk delete) |
  | `sendBillReminders` | `notifications/bill-reminder.service.ts` | system (manual-bill fan-out) + `withUserContext` per user's prefs/user reads |
  | `processAutoPostTransactions` | `scheduled-transactions/scheduled-transactions.service.ts` | system (tz/candidate fan-out) + `withUserContext` per `post` |
  | `closeExpiredPeriods` | `budgets/budget-period-cron.service.ts` | system (active-budget fan-out) + `withUserContext` per budget (open-period read + `closePeriod`) and per user (`sendMonthlySummaryForUser`) |
  | `checkBudgetAlerts` | `budgets/budget-alert.service.ts` | system (fan-out) + `withUserContext` per `processAlerts` |
  | `sendWeeklyDigest` | `budgets/budget-alert.service.ts` | system (fan-out) + `withUserContext` per `sendDigestForUser` |
  | `purgeOldAlerts` | `budgets/budget-alert.service.ts` | system (bulk deletes) |
  | `handleAutoBackupCron` | `backup/auto-backup.service.ts` | system (due-settings fan-out) + `withUserContext` per `exportToFile` + settings save |
  | `checkMortgageRenewals` | `accounts/mortgage-reminder.service.ts` | system (renewal fan-out) + `withUserContext` per user's prefs/user reads |
  | `applyDueTransactionBalances` | `accounts/accounts.service.ts` | system (fully cross-user: tz-bucketed bulk reads + single multi-user UPDATE) |
  | `scheduledRateRefresh` | `currencies/exchange-rate.service.ts` | system (currency-detection read spans all users' policied tables; writes global `exchange_rates`) |

**Scope:** every `@Cron` handler (~17 files / ~20 decorators; grep `@Cron` across `backend/src`).
Wrapping only, before any R task refactors these services — wrapping is inert pre-refactor.

**Do:** cross-user fan-out queries under `withSystemContext`; per-user bodies under
`withUserContext(userId)` so they keep the RLS net. Pattern per design Phase 4
(`processAutoPostTransactions`, `getUsersByEffectiveTimezone` are the named examples). Enumerate all
handlers in the PR description with which wrapper each got. (Note: crons verifiably run in the API
process — `ScheduleModule.forRoot()` in `app.module.ts`, no scheduler entrypoint exists; on k8s every
replica fires every cron, pre-existing.)

**Accept:** unit tests for at least the auto-post and demo-reset paths proving wrapper usage; full list
in PR; no handler left unwrapped (grep `@Cron` count == enumerated count).

### C3. Seeders + demo reset

- [x] Status: done (branch `claude/rls-task-status-column-8qqlbm`). Whole flows wrapped in
  `withSystemContext` (bodies extracted to `*WithinContext` privates): `SeedService.seedAll`,
  `DemoSeedService.seedAll` + `seedDemoData` (the latter also called directly by the daily reset), and
  both `DemoResetService` crons (`resetDemoData`, `generateIntradayTransactions` -- the two `@Cron`
  handlers deferred from C2). The `if (!isDemo) return` guards and the opening log lines stay outside
  the wrapper. A wrapper-usage test asserts `resetDemoData`'s raw SQL runs under `{ system: true }`.
  Seed/demo-seed/demo-reset specs green (56 + the new assertion), build + lint clean.

**Scope:** `database/seed.service.ts`, `demo-seed.service.ts`, daily demo reset entry. Wrapping only,
before R7 refactors the database module.

**Do:** wrap whole seed/reset flows in `withSystemContext` (raw cross-user SQL keeps working under
bypass).

**Accept:** seed + demo reset run green locally at `RLS_MODE=off`.

### C4. Emergency access

- [x] Status: done (branch `claude/rls-task-status-column-8qqlbm`). Both public claim handlers
  (`EmergencyAccessClaimController.preview` / `complete`) wrapped in `withSystemContext` (bodies
  extracted to `*WithinContext` privates) -- the requester is the grantee/bare token, so every
  owner-keyed read/write (the token-hash contact lookup, the owner's `users`/`user_preferences`/
  `trusted_devices`/`refresh_tokens` and the emergency-access tables, in a raw `queryRunner`
  transaction) runs under bypass. The expiry-monitor cron
  (`EmergencyAccessMonitorService.runDailyCheck` -- the `@Cron` deferred from C2) wraps its whole
  cross-user sweep in `withSystemContext` (the SMTP guard stays outside). Wrapper-usage tests assert
  both `preview` and the sweep run under `{ system: true }`; all emergency-access specs green (82).

  **Grantee-side read audit (result):** **no in-session grantee-side reads exist.** The authenticated
  surface (`emergency-access.controller.ts`, class-guarded by `AuthGuard('jwt') + StepUpGuard`) is
  entirely owner-keyed -- every `EmergencyAccessService` call passes `req.user.id` as the owner and
  every query filters `owner_user_id = :userId` (the `email` filters are duplicate-contact checks
  *within the owner's own* contact list, still owner-scoped). There is no "who named me as an
  emergency contact" lookup. So under the owner-only special policies
  (`emergency_access_settings|contacts → owner_user_id = current`) the authenticated reads work with
  the normal request context, and **no `withSystemContext` wrapping and no email-match policy arm are
  required** on that surface. The only grantee-facing path is the public claim controller, wrapped
  above.

**Scope:** `backend/src/emergency-access/emergency-access-claim.controller.ts` + claim service path,
expiry monitor. Wrapping only, before R7 refactors these services.

**Do:** claim flow (grantor's `users`/`trusted_devices`/`refresh_tokens` rows while requester is
grantee or bare token) and the expiry monitor's cross-user sweep under `withSystemContext`. Also
**audit for in-session grantee-side reads** of the emergency-access tables (a logged-in user listing
grants naming their email — the tables are owner-keyed with email/token grantee identification, so
such reads see zero rows under the owner-only policy): wrap any found in `withSystemContext` with
app-level filtering, or record a reviewed decision to extend the policy with an email-match arm.

**Accept:** emergency-access integration/e2e specs green; claim exercised end-to-end in the spec;
grantee-side audit result in the PR description.

### C5. Backup restore

- [ ] Status: **blocked** -- not started. Unlike C1-C4/C6 (which only depend on F2), C5 also depends
  on **M1** (the GUC-aware `update_updated_at_column()` trigger must be in the DB) and **R7** (the
  restore path must already be on `tenantTx` to carry the `preserveTimestamps` flag). Both are not
  started, so C5 cannot begin yet without a scope violation ("never start a task whose dependencies
  are unmerged").

**Scope:** `backend/src/backup/backup.service.ts` (restore path, ~line 1317).

**Do:** delete the `ALTER TABLE ... DISABLE TRIGGER` / `ENABLE TRIGGER` pair; run restore transactions
with `preserveTimestamps: true` in the ambient context so `tenantTx` emits the GUC per transaction.
Restore runs under the requesting user's normal context — no system bypass, no DDL.

**Deploy note (why this is "neutral", not "inert"):** this task changes how restore works **at
`RLS_MODE=off`** — the GUC path becomes the only thing preserving restored timestamps. Two
preconditions, both guaranteed by task order but verify anyway: M1's GUC-aware trigger is in the
deployed DB (migrations run at startup, M1 ships earlier), and F2's `tenantTx` emits
`app.preserve_timestamps` unconditionally (not mode-gated).

**Accept:** backup export + restore integration test **at `RLS_MODE=off`** proves restored
`updated_at` values preserved and no `must be owner of table` error path remains; no `DISABLE TRIGGER`
string left in `backup.service.ts`.

### C6. Interceptor restructure: fire-and-forget writes into the ALS scope

- [x] Status: done (branch `claude/rls-task-status-column-8qqlbm`). Both DB-touching helpers now run
  under `withUserContext(userId)`: `touchLastActivity`'s `users.update` and `resolveTimezone`'s
  `user_preferences` read + `lastClientTimezone` write. They run before the interceptor enters its
  `requestContextStorage.run({ userId, realUserId, timezone })` scope (that scope needs the resolved
  timezone), and all three accesses are owner-keyed (`users.id` / `user_preferences.userId` = the
  effective user), so `withUserContext(userId)` is the correct seed. Grep confirmed `request-context`
  is the only interceptor with DB writes (csrf-refresh sets cookies; the two delegate-mask
  interceptors only transform response payloads). Unit tests assert each of the three DB calls fires
  under `{ userId }`; the existing suite's non-UUID fixtures were moved to UUIDs (the wrap validates
  the id). Behavior at `RLS_MODE=off` unchanged (same rows, same fire-and-forget semantics).

**Scope:** `backend/src/common/interceptors/request-context.interceptor.ts`, any other post-response
writes found by grep.

**Do:** the interceptor's own DB calls currently run **outside** the scope it creates:
`touchLastActivity` fires and `resolveTimezone` reads/writes `user_preferences` *before*
`requestContextStorage.run()` is entered (`request-context.interceptor.ts:78-99` — the scope wraps
only `next.handle()`). Converted naively in R7, all three sites would throw on every authenticated
request. Restructure: move these calls inside the scope the interceptor establishes, or wrap each in
`withUserContext(userId)`. Behavior at `off` must be preserved (same writes, same fire-and-forget
semantics). Do not convert the repository calls to `tenantTx` here — R7 does that; this task only
guarantees ambient context exists when it happens.

**Accept:** unit tests cover both writes running inside a context scope; interceptor e2e/integration
behavior unchanged; no context-throw in dev smoke once R7 lands (verified again there).

## Finalization tasks

### L1. Lint bans

- [ ] Status: not started — requires R1–R7 complete (ratchet at zero).

**Do:** ESLint `no-restricted-imports`: `with-context.ts` importable only from the allowlist (admin,
auth bootstrap, emergency access, cron/jobs, seeders, backup). Ban `@InjectRepository` and
`createQueryRunner` outside `tenant-tx.ts` + test helpers. Remove the F3 ratchet script (superseded).

**Accept:** lint fails on a synthetic violation of each rule; clean on the real tree.

### D1. Docs

- [ ] Status: not started

**Do:** update root `CLAUDE.md` (QueryRunner section now points at `tenantTx` as the required pattern)
and `database/CLAUDE.md` (RLS migration conventions, "adding a new table" policy step — four buckets,
no role/grants in migrations); fix `backend/CLAUDE.md`'s **stale scheduler claim** (crons run in the
API process; there is no separate scheduler — delete or fix the dead `start:scheduler` script
reference); finalize `.env.example` comments; verify the helm chart values/ConfigMap and the CNPG
`managed.roles` requirement are documented for k8s operators; verify the runbook matches the
implemented reality and note it moves to `docs/rls.md` at ship time.

**Accept:** docs match code; `npm run i18n:check` clean; design doc's Verification section items 1–2
runnable as written.
