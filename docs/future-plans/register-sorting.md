# Column sorting on the Transactions register

Design for click-to-sort column headers on the Transactions page register
(issue #521): any data column sorts, the date column sorts in either
direction, and the running Balance column is shown only while the register
is in date order. This is the approved-spec half of a two-document plan; the
task list is [`register-sorting-tasks.md`](./register-sorting-tasks.md).

This document is the specification `docs/financial-calculation-contract.md`
section 9 asks for: it changes how a money figure (the running balance) is
seeded and walked, so it carries the invariants, truth tables, numerical
examples, missing-data policy and test matrix, and it is committed before any
implementation. The approach was agreed on the issue: the reporter asked for
sorting by any column with the date order toggleable; a second user proposed
the KMyMoney rule (no running balance under a non-date order); the maintainer
accepted it.

## 1. Goal

- **Every data column header on the Transactions register is a sort control**:
  Date, Account (when the column is drawn), Payee, Category, Description,
  Ref #, Amount, Status. Tags, Attachments, Balance, the foreign-currency
  trio and Actions are not sortable.
- **Clicking a header sorts by it; clicking it again reverses.** Date starts
  newest first (today's default); every other column starts ascending. The
  choice is remembered in the browser like the row density is.
- **The running balance is correct in both date directions, on every page.**
  A row shows the same balance whether the register runs newest-first or
  oldest-first; under the oldest-first order the first row's balance is the
  opening balance plus that row.
- **Under any other order the Balance column is not drawn**, and the register
  says why in one line ("Sort by date to see the running balance"), because a
  balance beside a row sorted by payee is not a figure anyone can read.
- **Nothing else changes.** The default state (date, newest first) is
  byte-identical on the page and on the wire; the six other surfaces that
  mount `TransactionList` keep their plain headers.

## 2. What exists, and what this composes

The feature adds no write path and no new financial arithmetic. It exposes a
sort the backend already applies, makes the running-balance seed
direction-aware, and reuses the sortable-header kit every report table uses.

| Need | Existing piece | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Sorted, paged register rows | `TransactionsService.findAll` (`backend/src/transactions/transactions.service.ts`) already takes `sortBy` and `sortDirection` | Reached today only by the AI assistant and MCP tools, always on page 1. The HTTP controller passes `undefined, undefined`. |
| One register order | `applyRegisterOrder` (`backend/src/transactions/register-order.ts`): primary column, `createdAt`, `amount` (credits before debits, opposite to the list), `id` | The ASC order is the exact reverse of the DESC order, a total order, so "the rows newer than a page" is well defined either way. |
| The running-balance seed | `startingBalance` on the list response: the balance after the newest row on the page, computed by `calculateUnfilteredBalance`, `calculateDateFilteredBalance`, `calculateContentFilteredBalance` / `calculateMultiAccountContentFilteredBalance` (through `computeFilteredPrevPagesSum`) | Each sums "the rows on previous pages" with `applyRegisterOrder(q, "t", "DESC")` **hardcoded** and `.limit(skip)`, and each has a `safePage === 1` shortcut. Both are descending-only truths; this is why a non-default sort corrupts every page-2+ balance today. |
| Which rows move a balance | `onlyBalanceAffecting` (`backend/src/transactions/balance-affecting.util.ts`): not VOID, not a split child | Unchanged. INV-TRANSFER-001. |
| The balance the newest row leaves | `AccountsService.getProjectedBalance` (`backend/src/accounts/accounts.service.ts`): opening balance plus every ledger-movement row, future-dated included | Unchanged. INV-BALANCE-001. |
| The client walk | `TransactionList.tsx`'s `runningBalances` memo: newest-first, `balance = seed - cumulative`, VOID and split children contribute 0, filtered split parents use `displayAmounts` | Moves to `lib/running-balance.ts` and gains a direction. |
| Sortable header kit | `useSortableTable` (`frontend/src/hooks/useSortableTable.ts`), `SortableHeader` (`frontend/src/components/ui/SortableHeader.tsx`), `SortColumn` / `SortColumnsByField` / `PHONE_HEADER_CLASS` (`frontend/src/components/ui/Table.tsx`) | The two-header-rows-from-one-record pattern is `frontend/src/components/reports/UncategorizedTransactionsReport.tsx`; the nearest register analogue is `frontend/src/components/reconcile/ReconcileTable.tsx`. |
| Deep link to one row | `targetTransactionId` -> `calculateTargetPage`, a hand-written newest-first comparison on (date, `createdAt`, `id`) | Gains the direction; refuses a non-date sort. |
| Query-parameter parsing | `parseTransactionStatuses`, `parseIds`, `assertStringParam` in `backend/src/transactions/transactions.controller.ts` | A sort parser joins them. |

## 3. Product decisions

1. **The sort is page state, remembered in the browser.** It lives on the
   Transactions page in `useSortableTable` under one key
   (`transactions.register.sort`), the way every report table remembers its
   sort. It is not a `user_preferences` column, not a URL parameter and not a
   filter: a laptop and a desktop need not agree, and a bookmarked filter URL
   should not carry a sort. `useSortableTable` persists through
   `useLocalStorage`, not a zustand store, so
   `frontend/src/store/persisted-storage.guard.test.ts` has nothing new to
   classify; the key is written only after a click on an authenticated page,
   so the pre-login footprint the guard pins is unchanged.
2. **The sort is part of the request key** (`docs/frontend/api-and-cache.md`).
   Changing it returns the register to page 1 through the same
   `isFilterChange` path a filter change takes, and the payload is adopted with
   the sort that produced it. It does **not** reach the calendar view's
   `getAllPages`, the CSV export or the chart requests: those are unsorted
   reads of the same filters.
3. **One field list, two layers.** `TRANSACTION_SORT_FIELDS` is declared once
   in `register-order.ts`, mirrored verbatim in
   `frontend/src/lib/transaction-sort.ts`, and a backend contract spec fails
   when the two differ (the pattern
   `backend/src/common/calendar-day-note.contract.spec.ts` uses for the note
   length). The AI assistant's and the MCP tool's `sortBy` enums derive from
   the same constant, so the model can ask for what the page can show.
4. **Date sorts newest-first on its first click; everything else ascending.**
   A register is read newest-first; a payee, category or status list is read
   A to Z. The same column toggles. `nextTransactionSort(prev, field)` is the
   one function that decides this, table-tested.
5. **Under a non-date order the balance is withheld, not zeroed, and the
   response says why.** `findAll` skips every balance query when
   `sortBy !== "date"` and sets `startingBalanceWithheld: "sort"` exactly when
   it *would* have computed a seed (a single account with rows, or content
   filters with rows). The client draws the Balance column only under a date
   sort, and draws the hint only when the flag says a balance was withheld,
   so an all-accounts unfiltered register, which never had a balance, is not
   promised one.
6. **In both date directions the seed means the same thing: the balance after
   the newest row on the page, and the client walks newest-first.** What
   changes is only *which rows are newer than the page*: under DESC they are
   the previous pages (`LIMIT skip` in DESC order, as today); under ASC they
   are the following pages (`OFFSET skip + limit` in ASC order). One helper,
   `restrictToRowsNewerThanPage`, is the only place that window is written.
   The client reverses its walk under ASC; the result is a map by id, so the
   rows render in the order they arrived and the filtered-split
   `displayAmounts` are read per row exactly as now. This keeps the existing
   DESC arithmetic byte-identical and makes the ASC case a mirror the
   integration suite can prove row by row (I1).
7. **The newest page is not always page 1.** The four `safePage === 1`
   shortcuts become `isNewestPage(window)`: `skip === 0` under DESC,
   `skip + limit >= total` under ASC. `findAll` already has `total` from
   `getManyAndCount` before it computes the seed.
8. **A non-date primary still reads chronologically within a group.**
   `applyRegisterOrder` inserts `transactionDate` (list direction) as the
   second leg whenever the primary is not the date, so one payee's rows come
   out in date order rather than insertion order. The date-sorted register and
   the three balance windows are untouched by this leg.
9. **Text columns sort in the database collation with `NULLS LAST` in both
   directions.** No `LOWER()`: `categories.service.ts` and
   `payees.service.ts` already order by the raw name, and a computed order key
   cannot be used on TypeORM's paginated-join path (section 6.3). A blank
   payee, category, description or reference sinks to the end whichever way
   the list runs, matching `compareValues` in `useSortableTable`.
10. **Status sorts by the stored value** (CLEARED, RECONCILED, UNRECONCILED,
    VOID alphabetically). A status sort is for grouping, and the raw column
    groups deterministically. A lifecycle rank (`ReconcileTable`'s
    `STATUS_RANK`) would need an `addSelect` alias on the paginated-join path
    and is recorded as a follow-up, not built here.
11. **A deep link is resolved under the date order only.** The page already
    drops every filter when a `targetTransactionId` arrives so the target is
    not hidden; a persisted non-date sort is reset the same way (to
    `{ field: 'date', direction }`, keeping the direction). The service
    refuses `targetTransactionId` with a non-date `sortBy` (400), so the AI
    and MCP entry points are covered by the same rule. Computing the page
    under an arbitrary sort would need a raw-SQL rendering of the register
    order with its own agreement guard; it is the right fix for the reported
    defect R1 and out of scope here.
12. **The Date header keeps the year toggle, and the toggle does not sort.**
    `SortableHeader` gains a `controls` slot rendered in a span that stops
    click and keydown propagation. No interactive element sits inside a
    button; the header stays one `<th role="columnheader">` with `aria-sort`.
13. **The phone layout keeps its slim header and gains the chip strip.** On a
    phone at Normal density the column header is replaced by a control row
    (select-all, the date toggle); when the list is sortable a second row of
    `PHONE_HEADER_CLASS` chips follows it, rendered from the same exhaustive
    record as the desktop headers, so a persisted field always has a control
    (`docs/frontend/tables-and-registers.md`, "A header that holds controls
    is replaced, never hidden").
14. **The `account` field on a single-account view resolves to the default
    sort** for both the request and the headers (`resolveRegisterSort`),
    without rewriting storage: the column is not in the DOM there, and
    widening the filter back brings the account sort back.
15. **The "today" divider follows the order.** A row is future by its own
    date, not by its index; the divider sits before the first non-future row
    under DESC, before the first future row under ASC, and is not drawn under
    a non-date order. Its source of "today" is unchanged (see R4).

## 4. Definitions

- **Sort field**: one of `TRANSACTION_SORT_FIELDS`:
  `date | account | payee | category | description | refNumber | amount | status`.
- **Direction**: `ASC | DESC` on the wire and in the service
  (`RegisterSortDirection`); `'asc' | 'desc'` in the browser
  (`SortDirection` from `useSortableTable`). The client sends lower case; the
  parser accepts either case.
- **Register order for field `f`, direction `d`**: `primary(f) d`, then
  `transactionDate d` (only when `f !== date`), then `createdAt d`, then
  `amount` in `creditsBeforeDebitsDirection(d)`, then `id d`. Written once,
  in `applyRegisterOrder`.
- **Page window**: `{ skip, limit, total, direction }` for the page being
  listed. `skip = (page - 1) * limit`.
- **Rows newer than the page**: under DESC, the first `skip` rows of the
  DESC order; under ASC, every row from position `skip + limit` of the ASC
  order. In both cases these are exactly the rows the register lists on
  pages nearer the newest end.
- **Seed** (`startingBalance`): the balance after the newest row on the page.
  Per regime: unfiltered, the projected balance minus the sum of the rows
  newer than the page; date-filtered with `endDate`, the balance at `endDate`
  minus that sum; content-filtered, the matched total minus that sum
  (zero-based). Sums go through `onlyBalanceAffecting` and, where a category
  or tag filter narrows split lines, `computeSplitAwareSum`.
- **Walk**: rows in newest-first order; `balance(row) = seed - cumulative`,
  then `cumulative += amount` when the row affects the balance. Under ASC the
  page is reversed before walking.
- **Newest page**: the page holding the newest row of the whole listing.
  `skip === 0` under DESC; `skip + limit >= total` under ASC.

## 5. Invariants

| # | Invariant | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| I1 | **A row's running balance is the same figure whichever way the date register runs**, and the oldest row's balance minus its amount is the opening balance (unfiltered) or zero (content-filtered). | `restrictToRowsNewerThanPage` is the one window; `walkRunningBalances` is the one walk; `register-sort.integration.spec.ts` asserts `balance(ASC)[id] === balance(DESC)[id]` for every row across page boundaries with a VOID row, a split parent, a same-`created_at` pair and a future row. INV-REGISTER-001 (new). |
| I2 | **No balance is shown under a non-date order**, and the register says why. | `findAll` skips the seed and sets `startingBalanceWithheld: "sort"`; `showRunningBalance` carries the date-sort term and `ui-conventions.test.ts` pins the expression; the hint renders iff the flag is `'sort'`. |
| I3 | **The register order and its page window are written once.** | `register-order.spec.ts` asserts exactly one `applyRegisterOrder(` and three `restrictToRowsNewerThanPage(` in the service, no `addOrderBy(...createdAt` and no `.limit(` / `.offset(` beside a `select("t.id")` there. |
| I4 | **One field list in both layers**, and the AI/MCP enums derive from it. | `register-sort.contract.spec.ts` reads `frontend/src/lib/transaction-sort.ts` and compares; the zod schemas use `z.enum(TRANSACTION_SORT_FIELDS)`. |
| I5 | **A persisted sort field always has a control.** | Both header rows render `Object.values(columns)` from one `SortColumnsByField` record (a field missing from it is a compile error); `resolveRegisterSort` handles `account` on a single-account view. |
| I6 | **The sort is part of the request key and resets the page.** | `loadTransactions` lists the effective sort in its dependencies and sends it; `handleSort` sets `isFilterChange`; `page.test.tsx` asserts page 1 after a header click while on page 3. |
| I7 | **The sort never leaks into the calendar, the export or the charts.** | `transactionsApi.getAll` sends `sortBy` / `sortDirection` only when given; `page.test.tsx` asserts `getAllPages` is never called with `sortBy`. |
| I8 | **A deep link resolves under the date order only.** | Service refusal (`errors.transactions.targetRequiresDateSort`) before any query; the page resets a non-date sort where it sets `targetTransactionIdRef`. |
| I9 | **A request without sort parameters is byte-identical to today's**, on the wire and in SQL. | Defaults `date` / `DESC`; the DESC branch of the window is `applyRegisterOrder(..., "DESC").limit(skip)` as today; the "unfiltered starting balance (preserved behavior)" and sibling describe blocks in `transactions.service.spec.ts` pass untouched. |

## 6. Data contracts

### 6.1 `GET /transactions` (changed, additive)

Two optional query parameters:

- `sortBy`: one of `TRANSACTION_SORT_FIELDS`; default `date`.
- `sortDirection`: `asc` or `desc`, case-insensitive; default `desc`.

Parsed by `parseTransactionSort(sortBy, sortDirection)` in
`backend/src/transactions/register-sort-param.ts`: `assertStringParam` first
(a repeated key arrives as an array), then the allowlist. An unknown value is
400 with `errors.transactions.invalidSortBy` / `invalidSortDirection`, naming
the accepted values. Both are documented with `@ApiQuery`.

`targetTransactionId` together with a `sortBy` other than `date` is 400 with
`errors.transactions.targetRequiresDateSort`, raised in the service so every
caller meets it.

Response (`PaginatedTransactions`) gains one optional field:

```typescript
interface PaginatedTransactions extends PaginatedResult<TransactionWithInvestmentLink> {
  startingBalance?: number;            // unchanged: the balance after the newest row on the page
  startingBalanceWithheld?: "sort";    // present iff a seed would have been computed but sortBy !== "date"
}
```

### 6.2 `register-order.ts` (changed)

```typescript
export const TRANSACTION_SORT_FIELDS = [
  "date", "account", "payee", "category", "description", "refNumber", "amount", "status",
] as const;
export type TransactionSortField = (typeof TRANSACTION_SORT_FIELDS)[number];
export function isTransactionSortField(value: unknown): value is TransactionSortField;

export interface RegisterSortAliases { account?: string; category?: string }
/** The primary ORDER BY term for a field. Throws for a joined field whose alias was not supplied. */
export function registerPrimaryOrder(
  field: TransactionSortField, transactionAlias: string, aliases?: RegisterSortAliases,
): { expression: string; nulls?: "NULLS LAST" };

export function applyRegisterOrder<T extends ObjectLiteral>(
  qb: SelectQueryBuilder<T>, alias: string, direction: RegisterSortDirection,
  field: TransactionSortField = "date", aliases?: RegisterSortAliases,
): SelectQueryBuilder<T>;

export interface RegisterPageWindow { skip: number; limit: number; total: number; direction: RegisterSortDirection }
export function isNewestPage(window: RegisterPageWindow): boolean;
/** DESC: the first `skip` rows; ASC: every row from `skip + limit`. Date order only. */
export function restrictToRowsNewerThanPage<T extends ObjectLiteral>(
  qb: SelectQueryBuilder<T>, alias: string, window: RegisterPageWindow,
): SelectQueryBuilder<T>;
```

Primary terms: date -> `t.transactionDate`; account -> `account.name` NULLS
LAST; payee -> `t.payeeName` NULLS LAST; category -> `category.name` NULLS
LAST; description -> `t.description` NULLS LAST; refNumber ->
`t.referenceNumber` NULLS LAST; amount -> `t.amount`; status -> `t.status`.
The balance windows call `applyRegisterOrder(q, "t", direction)` with the
default field and no aliases, so they can never be asked for a joined order.
`restrictToRowsNewerThanPage`'s ASC branch passes `skip + limit`, which is at
least 1, so TypeORM never drops a falsy offset.

### 6.3 What TypeORM's paginated-join path allows

`findAll` pages with `.skip().take().getManyAndCount()` over
`leftJoinAndSelect` joins, so TypeORM 0.3 runs its two-query path: a
`SELECT DISTINCT` of the transaction ids plus the order columns, ordered and
limited, then the rows for those ids. Three consequences the implementation
respects and the integration suite proves:

- An order key must be `alias.property` of a **selected** alias. `account`,
  `payee` and `category` are `leftJoinAndSelect` in `findAll`, so
  `account.name` and `category.name` resolve. A raw expression (`CASE`,
  `LOWER`) cannot be an order key there (decisions 9 and 10).
- An order key on a one-to-many alias (`tags`, `splits`) would make the
  DISTINCT emit duplicate ids and a page repeat rows. `TRANSACTION_SORT_FIELDS`
  never names one; the register-order spec's "throws without an alias" case
  and the field list itself hold this.
- `NULLS LAST` is carried through both queries.

### 6.4 Frontend contracts

`frontend/src/lib/transaction-sort.ts` (pure):

```typescript
export const TRANSACTION_SORT_FIELDS = [/* the mirror */] as const;
export type TransactionSortField = (typeof TRANSACTION_SORT_FIELDS)[number];
export type TransactionSort = SortState<TransactionSortField>;
export const TRANSACTION_SORT_STORAGE_KEY = 'transactions.register.sort';
export const DEFAULT_TRANSACTION_SORT: TransactionSort = { field: 'date', direction: 'desc' };
export function nextTransactionSort(prev: TransactionSort, field: TransactionSortField): TransactionSort;
export function resolveRegisterSort(sort: TransactionSort, isSingleAccountView: boolean): TransactionSort;
export function isSortedByDate(sort: TransactionSort | undefined): boolean;   // undefined is the unsorted register: true
```

`frontend/src/lib/running-balance.ts` (pure):

```typescript
export function rowAffectsBalance(row: Pick<Transaction, 'status' | 'parentTransactionId'>): boolean;
export function walkRunningBalances(
  rows: readonly Transaction[], startingBalance: number | undefined,
  direction: SortDirection, displayAmounts: ReadonlyMap<string, number>,
): Map<string, number>;   // empty when the seed is absent or NaN; ASC walks [...rows].reverse()
```

`TransactionList` props gain `sort?: TransactionSort`,
`onSortChange?: (field: TransactionSortField) => void` and
`startingBalanceWithheld?: 'sort'`. `TransactionsGetAllParams` gains
`sortBy?: TransactionSortField` and `sortDirection?: 'asc' | 'desc'`, sent
only when set. The frontend `PaginatedTransactions` type gains
`startingBalanceWithheld?: 'sort'`.

## 7. Truth tables

### A. Balance column and hint, by sort field and regime

| Sort field | Regime | `startingBalance` | `startingBalanceWithheld` | Balance column | Hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| date (either direction) | single account, rows | seed | absent | drawn | none |
| date | several accounts, content filters, rows | zero-based seed | absent | drawn | none |
| date | all accounts, content filters, rows | zero-based seed | absent | drawn | none |
| date | several / all accounts, no content filters | absent | absent | not drawn | none |
| date | any regime, no rows | absent | absent | empty state | none |
| not date | single account, rows | absent | `"sort"` | not drawn | shown |
| not date | several / all accounts, content filters, rows | absent | `"sort"` | not drawn | shown |
| not date | several / all accounts, no content filters | absent | absent | not drawn | none |
| not date | no rows | absent | absent | empty state | none |

The client reads the flag as `=== 'sort'`; absent means nothing to say.

### B. Rows newer than the page, by direction

| Direction | `skip` | `limit` | `total` | Window | `isNewestPage` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DESC | 0 | 2 | 5 | none (no query) | yes |
| DESC | 2 | 2 | 5 | first 2 rows of DESC order (`LIMIT 2`) | no |
| DESC | 4 | 2 | 5 | first 4 rows of DESC order | no |
| ASC | 0 | 2 | 5 | rows from position 2 of ASC order (`OFFSET 2`, the three newest) | no |
| ASC | 2 | 2 | 5 | rows from position 4 (`OFFSET 4`, the newest) | no |
| ASC | 4 | 2 | 5 | none (no query) | yes (`4 + 2 >= 5`) |
| ASC | 0 | 50 | 5 | none | yes (one page is the newest page) |

### C. "Today" divider

| Order | Page composition (listed order) | Divider |
|---|---|---|
| date DESC | future, future, past, past | before the first past row |
| date DESC | past only | none |
| date DESC | future only | none |
| date ASC | past, past, future, future | before the first future row |
| date ASC | past only / future only | none |
| any other | any | none; rows are still dimmed individually by their own date |

### D. Header click

| Current sort | Clicked | Next sort |
|---|---|---|
| date desc | date | date asc |
| date asc | date | date desc |
| payee asc | date | date desc |
| date desc | payee | payee asc |
| payee asc | payee | payee desc |
| payee desc | category | category asc |
| account asc, single-account view | (rendered as date desc; the Account chip is absent) | unchanged in storage; effective sort date desc |

### E. Deep link and persisted sort

| Persisted sort | Arrives with `targetTransactionId` | Request sent | Sort shown |
|---|---|---|---|
| date desc | yes | `sortBy=date&sortDirection=desc&targetTransactionId=...` | date desc |
| date asc | yes | `sortBy=date&sortDirection=asc&targetTransactionId=...` | date asc; the page containing the target under ASC |
| payee asc | yes | `sortBy=date&sortDirection=asc&targetTransactionId=...` | date asc (storage updated to date asc) |
| any | AI or MCP caller passes `targetTransactionId` with a non-date `sortBy` | 400 `targetRequiresDateSort` | n/a |

## 8. Numerical examples

All money at 4dp internally, printed at 2dp. Every example is reproduced by
`register-order.spec.ts` or `transactions.service.spec.ts`, by
`running-balance.test.ts`, and end to end by
`register-sort.integration.spec.ts`.

1. **Four debits, page size 2, the newest VOID.** Opening 1000; A -10 on
   2026-01-01, B -10 on 01-02, C -10 on 01-03, D -10 on 01-04 (D is VOID).
   Projected balance = 1000 - 30 = 970.
   - DESC page 1 (newest page): seed 970; D 970 (VOID moves nothing), C 970.
   - DESC page 2: rows newer = {D, C}, balance-affecting sum -10; seed 980;
     B 980, A 990.
   - ASC page 1 (A, B): rows newer = `OFFSET 2` of ASC = {C, D}, sum -10;
     seed 980; the reversed walk (B, A) gives B 980, A 990.
   - ASC page 2 (C, D): newest page, seed 970; reversed walk (D, C) gives
     D 970, C 970.
   Every id agrees; A's balance minus A's amount is 1000.
2. **A same-`created_at` credit and debit, page size 1.** Opening 0;
   TRANSFER_IN +2400 and PURCHASE -2400 on one day, written by one import.
   The order puts the credit chronologically first in both directions
   (`creditsBeforeDebitsDirection`). DESC page 1 = PURCHASE, seed 0 -> 0;
   page 2 = TRANSFER_IN, rows newer = {PURCHASE}, seed 0 - (-2400) = 2400.
   ASC page 1 = TRANSFER_IN, rows newer = `OFFSET 1` = {PURCHASE}, seed 2400;
   page 2 = PURCHASE, newest page, seed 0. Never negative, either way.
3. **Payee-filtered, zero-based, page size 2.** Matched rows oldest to
   newest: P1 -50, P2 -30, P3 +100. Matched total = 20.
   - DESC page 1 (P3, P2): seed 20; P3 20, P2 -80. Page 2 (P1): rows newer
     sum +70; seed -50; P1 -50.
   - ASC page 1 (P1, P2): rows newer = {P3}, sum +100; seed 20 - 100 = -80;
     reversed walk (P2, P1): P2 -80, P1 -50. Page 2 (P3): newest page; seed
     20; P3 20.
4. **A filtered split parent.** A category filter matches one of a split
   parent's two lines (-40 of a -100 parent). Its `displayAmount` is -40 on
   the client and `computeSplitAwareSum` counts -40 in the window on the
   server, in both directions; the parity property holds because both sides
   read the same predicate.

## 9. Missing-data policy

- Under a non-date order the balance is **withheld**, never zeroed and never
  computed against a meaningless neighbour; the response carries
  `startingBalanceWithheld: "sort"` and the register prints the hint. A
  reader learns what is missing and how to get it back (sort by date).
- `startingBalanceWithheld` absent means nothing to say, not "a balance is
  coming": the all-accounts unfiltered register shows neither a column nor a
  hint, as today.
- A `startingBalance` that is absent or `NaN` still renders `-` in every
  balance cell, as today; the walk returns an empty map.
- A failed reload keeps the rows, the seed, the flag and the sort together
  (`docs/frontend/api-and-cache.md`); the sort a payload was fetched under is
  the sort it is walked under.
- `NULL` text values sort last in both directions; they are not rendered as
  empty strings anywhere new.

## 10. Frontend structure

- `lib/transaction-sort.ts` (pure): the mirror constant and the four helpers
  in section 6.4; `transaction-sort.test.ts` tables D and E's client rows.
- `lib/running-balance.ts` (pure): `walkRunningBalances`, `rowAffectsBalance`;
  `running-balance.test.ts` reproduces examples 1 to 4 in both directions.
- `components/ui/SortableHeader.tsx`: an optional `controls` slot whose span
  stops `click` and `keydown` propagation; its test proves activating the
  control leaves `aria-sort` unchanged.
- `components/transactions/TransactionList.tsx`:
  - a `columns: SortColumnsByField<TransactionSortField, RegisterSortColumn>`
    record holding `field`, `label` (`list.header.*`) and `align`, with
    `account` dropped from `Object.values` output on a single-account view;
  - each sortable `<th>` becomes `<SortableHeader ... className={...}>` when
    `sort` is supplied and stays the plain `<th>` otherwise, through one small
    render helper in the file. The `registerColumnClass('...')` and
    `REGISTER_PAYEE_CELL_FLOOR` literals stay inline on each header cell in
    today's order: `register-columns.guard.test.ts` compares their source
    order against `REGISTER_COLUMN_ORDER` without deduplication, so the record
    must not carry them;
  - `showRunningBalance = (isSingleAccountView || startingBalance !== undefined) && isSortedByDate(sort)`;
  - `runningBalances = walkRunningBalances(transactions, startingBalance, sort?.direction ?? 'desc', displayAmounts)`;
  - per-row `isFuture` by date; the divider per table C;
  - the hint (`list.sort.hint`) in `ListTopToolbar`'s `actions` slot when
    `startingBalanceWithheld === 'sort'`;
  - in the wrapped phone layout, a second `<tr>` of `PHONE_HEADER_CLASS`
    chips (`aria-label` `list.sort.stripLabel`) after the slim control row,
    only when `sort` is supplied.
- `app/transactions/page.tsx`: `useSortableTable` with the storage key and
  default; `handleSort` sets `isFilterChange` and `setSort(prev => nextTransactionSort(prev, field))`;
  `effectiveSort = resolveRegisterSort(sort, isSingleAccountView)` sent by
  `loadTransactions` and listed in its dependencies; `startingBalanceWithheld`
  adopted in the same block as `data`, `pagination` and `startingBalance`; the
  deep-link reset beside the two places that set `targetTransactionIdRef`.
- `lib/transactions.ts`: `TransactionsGetAllParams` and `getAll` send
  `sortBy` / `sortDirection` only when set.
- i18n: `transactions.list.sort.hint` ("Sort by date to see the running
  balance") and `transactions.list.sort.stripLabel` ("Sort by"); the backend's
  three `errors.transactions.*` keys. English first, pseudo-locale
  regenerated, every locale in the final task.
- `page.test.tsx` stubs `useLocalStorage` statelessly today; the sort tests
  override it with a `useState`-backed implementation in their own describe.

## 11. Test matrix

| Layer | Test | Proves |
|---|---|---|
| backend unit | `register-order.spec.ts` | the order per field and direction, the date second leg under a non-date primary, `NULLS LAST` on the text fields, a joined field without its alias throws, table B (window and `isNewestPage`), examples 1 and 2 through the recorded builder, I3's three counts and two bans |
| backend unit | `register-sort-param.spec.ts` | defaults; both cases of the direction; an array or unknown value is 400 naming the accepted values |
| backend unit | `transactions.service.spec.ts` | in each starting-balance describe block an ASC twin expecting `offset(skip + limit)` and no `limit(...)`; an ASC newest-page case that issues no window query; a non-date case with `startingBalance` absent, `startingBalanceWithheld: "sort"` and no balance query; target + non-date rejects; `calculateTargetPage` flips under ASC; every existing DESC case untouched (I9) |
| backend unit | `transactions.controller.spec.ts` | the parsed pair reaches `findAll` where `undefined, undefined` sat; `?sortBy=tags` is 400 |
| backend unit | `register-sort.contract.spec.ts` | the two field lists are equal (I4) |
| backend integration | `register-sort.integration.spec.ts` | I1 on examples 1 to 4 plus an `endDate` filter and a two-account category filter; for all 8 fields x 2 directions at page size 2: pages disjoint, union complete, `total` right, NULLs last, ties in date order; the withheld flag per table A; the same target on mirrored pages under DESC and ASC; target + payee refused |
| frontend unit | `running-balance.test.ts` | examples 1 to 4 both ways; VOID and split children contribute 0; absent seed gives an empty map |
| frontend unit | `transaction-sort.test.ts` | tables D and E (client rows); `resolveRegisterSort`; `isSortedByDate(undefined)` is true |
| frontend unit | `SortableHeader.test.tsx` | a control in the slot does not sort on click or Enter |
| frontend unit | `TransactionList.test.tsx` | with `sort`, a `columnheader` with `aria-sort` per field (one fewer on a single-account view); `sort.field === 'amount'` hides the Balance header even with `isSingleAccountView`; the hint iff the flag; without `sort` the header markup is unchanged; table C |
| frontend unit | `TransactionList.mobileWrapped.test.tsx` | with `sort` every field has a chip and the slim row keeps the toggle and select-all; without `sort` the existing one-cell assertion holds; a chip click calls `onSortChange` |
| frontend unit | `page.test.tsx` | I6 (page 1 after a click on page 3), table D through real clicks, I7 (`getAllPages` never sees `sortBy`), table E's client rows, `resolveRegisterSort` on a single account |
| frontend guard | `ui-conventions.test.ts` | the balance expression carries the date term; `startingBalance` beside every `isSingleAccountView` (unchanged) |
| frontend guard | `register-columns.guard.test.ts`, `interactive-row.guard.test.ts`, `density-preference.guard.test.ts`, `persisted-storage.guard.test.ts`, `balance-cache.guard.test.ts` | green with no baseline change |
| e2e | `e2e/tests/transactions.spec.ts`, `e2e/tests/mobile.spec.ts` | click Amount: rows in amount order, no Balance header, the hint; click Date: the Balance is back with per-row figures; click Date again: `aria-sort="ascending"` and the same figure beside the same row; reload keeps the sort; page 2 under ascending continues page 1; on a phone the chip strip is present and the year toggle still works |

A green suite after a behaviour change is a finding: each task's acceptance
names the test that turned red first.

## 12. Explicit v1 scope cuts

- Sorting on the six other `TransactionList` surfaces (category and payee
  detail tabs, the investments page's cash register, the foreign-currency
  fee sections and report). The props make it a small follow-up each.
- Sorting by tags or attachment count (one-to-many; would duplicate rows on
  the paginated-join path).
- A lifecycle order for Status (decision 10).
- A deep link resolved under a non-date order (decision 11, R1).
- Carrying the sort into the CSV export or the calendar.
- A server-side `user_preferences` sort, or a URL parameter.

## 14. Reported, not fixed

Pre-existing, found while designing; each is its own proposal.

- **R1 (fixed).** `calculateTargetPage` compared on three of the four
  ordering keys and rebuilt a subset of the filters, so a deep link could land
  on a page that does not hold the row it was following. It counts over
  `buildFilteredIdsSubquery` now -- the same row set the balance sums -- and
  compares on all four keys, with the amount leg running opposite to the list.
  It also read the target's `created_at` through the entity, which truncates
  microseconds to milliseconds, so the row came out newer than its own
  timestamp and counted itself; the keys are read out as text now. A deep link
  under a non-date sort is still refused rather than placed (decision 11):
  placing one needs `ROW_NUMBER()` over a raw rendering of the register order,
  which is a second spelling of the order this plan exists to keep single.
- **R2 (fixed).** `backend/src/accounts/account-export.service.ts` walked its
  exported running balance over a hand-written order without the amount leg,
  so an export could show the account overdrawn on a day a transfer had funded
  the purchase. It calls `applyRegisterOrder` now, and the guard widened from
  one file to a scan of the layer: a file carrying a `runningBalance` takes its
  order from there.
- **R3 (fixed).** Those four filters, and the brokerage exclusion, narrowed
  the listing without reaching the balance, which fell through to the
  unfiltered regime -- the account's whole projected balance, walked down past
  rows that are not on screen. `RegisterRowFilters` names the set once now and
  `buildFilteredIdsSubquery` applies all of it; an integration test asserts the
  seed equals the sum of the rows the listing returns, per filter.
- **R4 (fixed).** The register's "today" divider read the browser's clock; it
  reads `useFinancialToday()` now, so a traveller's laptop no longer decides
  which rows are still to come.
- **R5 (assessed, no change).** `getLlmTransactionRows` reads page 1 only and
  discards `startingBalance`. That is the design rather than a defect: the
  bound is what keeps a tool result inside its token budget, and a seed is
  meaningless without the walk that turns it into a column. The model gets the
  sort it asked for and no balance, which is the honest answer.

## 15. Companion task list

[`register-sorting-tasks.md`](./register-sorting-tasks.md) breaks this into
one-session tasks with dependencies, deploy impact and acceptance.
