/**
 * The fetch lease against a real database.
 *
 * Every property here belongs to PostgreSQL rather than to the service: the
 * primary key decides who wins, the `DO UPDATE ... WHERE` arm decides whether an
 * existing lease may be retaken, and the token in the predicate decides whether
 * a late worker may write. A mocked manager can return whatever it is told to
 * and demonstrate none of it, so the race below is on **two separate
 * connections** (VER-001, `docs/verification-contract.md`).
 *
 * This lease is a cost control, not a correctness mechanism -- the fetches it
 * guards write idempotent upserts -- so "a lost lease never blocks the next
 * tick" is as much a requirement as "only one winner", and both are tested.
