/**
 * INV-HOLDING-001 -- the stored holding is a projection of the ledger, through
 * the real service and a real database (issue #1388).
 *
 * The concurrency half of the invariant has its own spec
 * (holding-concurrent-trades.integration.spec.ts). This one is about ORDER: a
 * holding maintained as an accumulator is a function of the order rows were
 * ENTERED in, and the ledger is a function of the dates they carry. The two
 * disagree the moment a trade is back-dated, which is the ordinary case -- a
 * statement reconciled a month late, an import, a corrected date.
 *
 * The reproduction from the issue, entered in this order:
 *
 *   1. BUY  100 @ 10.00  dated 2026-01-01
 *   2. BUY  100 @ 20.00  dated 2026-03-01
 *   3. SELL  50 @ 12.00  dated 2026-02-01   <- entered LAST, dated in between
 *
 * Replayed by date the sale relieves basis at 10.00 (the only lot it could have
 * come from), leaving 150 shares carrying 2,500: 16.6667 a share. Blended in
 * insertion order the two purchases average to 15.00 before the sale arrives,
 * the sale relieves 750, and 150 shares carry 2,250: 15.0000 a share -- the
 * figure the holdings page showed while `POST /holdings/rebuild` said 16.6667.
 *
 * Every expectation here is computed by replaying the PERSISTED ledger rather
 * than from the fixture's arithmetic, so the test bites on any divergence
 * between what the service stored and what the ledger says, not only on the one
 * number the issue reported.
