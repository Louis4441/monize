/**
 * The import's per-row balance write against a real `decimal(20,4)` column.
 *
 * Mechanism under test: `updateAccountBalance`
 * (`backend/src/import/import-context.ts`), one atomic delta statement --
 * `UPDATE accounts SET current_balance = ROUND(CAST(current_balance AS numeric)
 * + $1, 4) WHERE id = $2` -- which is row 1 of
 * `docs/concurrency-and-idempotency.md` section 2 and the same statement
 * `AccountsService.updateBalance` issues.
 *
 * It used to be a `findOne` followed by an absolute `update` of a sum computed
 * in JavaScript and rounded to 2dp. Two properties only a real database can
 * decide are asserted here: the imported amounts land at the column's 4dp
 * precision, and two deltas on two connections compose instead of one
 * overwriting the other.
