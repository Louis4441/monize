/**
 * The `s3` backup store against a real S3-compatible service (MinIO).
 *
 * The unit suite proves which command is constructed and what is in it. What it
 * cannot prove is the half of INV-BACKUP-006 that belongs to the service rather
 * than to our code: **S3 applies an object to its key only on a complete,
 * checksum-matching upload.** A double that resolves whatever it is handed
 * demonstrates none of that, which is exactly the shape VER-001
 * (`docs/verification-contract.md`) rules out for a claim about an external
 * system. So the checks here are the ones that need a server: a declared
 * checksum that does not match the bytes is refused rather than accepted, an
 * aborted upload leaves the key absent, and a full hourly cycle -- publish,
 * promote, list, prune -- round-trips through a real bucket.
 *
 * **This suite is gated on `BACKUP_STORE_S3_TEST_ENDPOINT`.** It runs wherever a
 * MinIO (or other S3-compatible) endpoint is reachable, and the
 * `backend-integration-tests` CI job is where it is meant to run -- that job has
 * only `postgres` today, and adding the service is the last step of task S2 in
 * `docs/future-plans/horizontal-scaling-tasks.md`, which records the exact
 * service block and why it is not in this commit. The gate is deliberately one
 * variable and deliberately loud in this comment rather than a bare `describe.skip`:
 * a suite that quietly discovers nothing is a suite nobody notices is not running.
