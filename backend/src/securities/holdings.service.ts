   *
   * This is the door every investment-transaction write path goes through

   * `investment_transactions`, not an accumulator: an incremental
   * `new = old + delta` blends a purchase into the average cost in INSERTION
   * order, so a back-dated SELL entered after a later BUY relieved basis that
   * the replay says it never held. The lock gives economic order no protection
   * at all -- it serializes writers, and the defect is a single writer's
   * arithmetic (issue #1388).
   *
   * A scope the ledger has no rows for projects to "no holding": the row is
   * deleted, exactly as `POST /holdings/rebuild` has always done. The ledger is
   * the record; a holding with no rows behind it is a residue, not an opening
   * position, and an opening position is imported as an ADD_SHARES row.
   *
   * Only the named scopes are touched, so a write in one security cannot
   * rewrite an unrelated position in the same account.
