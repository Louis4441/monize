/**
 * One portfolio valuation per user, scope and minute.
 *
 * Opening the Investments page issues three requests that each need the same
 * valuation -- `GET /portfolio/summary`, `GET /portfolio/allocation/by-tag` and
 * (until this change) `GET /portfolio/tag-keys` -- and they start together, so
 * the server priced the same holdings three times concurrently. The valuation
 * is expensive for a reason that is not going away: live FX priming, a
 * per-holding cost-basis replay, and a day-by-day since-inception result.
 *
 * This memo holds the *in-flight promise*, not only the settled value, which is
 * what makes concurrent callers share one computation rather than three. A
 * rejection is never cached: the entry is dropped so the next caller recomputes
 * instead of inheriting a failure for a minute.
 *
 * It is process memory, deliberately -- but its invalidation is not. A write
 * served by pod A used to leave pod B answering from its own memo for up to
 * {@link PORTFOLIO_SUMMARY_MEMO_TTL_MS}, which a load balancer with no affinity
 * turns into "the trade I just entered is not there" on the very next read.
 * Every invalidation is therefore announced on the `EventBus` and applied by
 * every replica (see {@link PORTFOLIO_SUMMARY_INVALIDATION_CHANNEL}). The bus
 * can drop a message, so the TTL remains the bound rather than the mechanism;
 * `docs/backend/securities-and-providers.md` states what each one covers.
