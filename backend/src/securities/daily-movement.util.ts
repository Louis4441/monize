 * that can fail to hold, in the order of truth table B in
 * `docs/future-plans/calendar-view.md`:
 *
 * 1. Not a trading day -> blank. No security the scope held struck a close, so
 *    there is no market observation to compare; a weekend deposit is not a gain.
 * 2. MV(d) incomplete -> unknown, carrying its own causes. A subtotal minus a
 *    total is not a movement.
 * 3. MV(d-1) missing or incomplete -> unknown. A first day has no baseline, and
 *    the day before being a subtotal makes the difference meaningless.
 * 4. Flow incomplete -> unknown. An unconvertible contribution is
 *    indistinguishable from a market move; counting it as zero would report the
 *    reader's own deposit as a gain (INV-PORTMOVE-002).
 * 5. MV(d-1) is zero -> no percentage. The movement itself is known and is
 *    returned; the ratio is not.
 *
 * Pure, so the whole policy is table-tested without a database. The client reads
 * `complete` and `reasons` and never re-derives a row of this table.
