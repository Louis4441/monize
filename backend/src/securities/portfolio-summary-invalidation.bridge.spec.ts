/**
 * Issue #1409: the memo was invalidated only on the replica that served the
 * write, so the next read -- round-robined to another replica -- answered from
 * a valuation taken before the trade. These cases are the two ends of the
 * repair: what this replica announces, and what it does with an announcement.
 *
 * `MemoryEventBus` is the real bus rather than a mock: it defers delivery to a
 * later tick exactly as the PostgreSQL one does, so a bridge that only worked
 * because delivery was synchronous fails here too.
