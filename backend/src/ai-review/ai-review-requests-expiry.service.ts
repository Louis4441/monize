 * Hourly upkeep of the AI review queue, across every user.
 *
 * 1. Requests past `expires_at` in any open state become `expired`
 *    (`AiReviewRequestsService.expireStale`, the same single conditional
 *    UPDATE, which `claimNext` already treats as authoritative by comparing
 *    `expires_at` in the database's clock).
 * 2. A request still `claimed` after `AI_REVIEW_CLAIM_TIMEOUT_MINUTES` goes back
 *    to `pending` with the claim cleared, so an agent that crashed between
 *    claiming and proposing does not hold a request until it expires. An agent
 *    that was only slow finds its later proposal refused, because the
 *    transition is conditional on `status = 'claimed'`, and claims again.
 *
 * Expiry runs first, so a request past its life is never resurrected. Both
 * cutoffs are `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` in the database, never a clock this process
 * holds, and both are conditional on the stored status, so every replica firing
 * this cron (`docs/cron-jobs.md`) touches the same rows and the losers touch
 * none; `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` keeps two of them from waiting on one another.
 * No request stands behind a cron and the rows belong to every user, so it runs
 * under `withSystemContext`.
