/**
 * Every row written to `exchange_rates` is oriented by one helper.
 *
 * The table used to hold two rows per pair and date, the fetched direction and a
 * synthesised inverse, because two readers asked a direction-specific question.
 * Nothing kept the two reciprocal: a writer that touched one side only left a
 * pair whose rows disagreed about one date, and `resolveFxRate` picks the more
 * recently observed direction, so which figure a date resolved to depended on
 * which row happened to be newer. The Money importer was exactly such a writer.
 *
 * One orientation per pair removes the class. The rule is mechanical -- it is
 * about the shape of a write, not about a judgement a reviewer has to make on
 * each one -- so it is held here rather than in a paragraph: a third writer, or
 * one of the two that stops calling the helper, fails this scan
 * (`docs/specs/exchange-rate-canonical-orientation.md`, INV-FX-003).
 *
 * Reads are not restricted. A reader asks for a pair in whichever direction its
 * caller cares about and `resolveFxRate` resolves it; that is the point of the
 * collapse, not something to police.
