/**
 * How many restores may be *processing* -- decrypting, decompressing, parsing,
 * staging -- at the same time.
 *
 * The upload admission gate (`restore-upload-admission.ts`) bounds concurrent
 * compressed bodies. It cannot bound what those bodies cost once they decompress,
 * because a small gzip expands to a large payload: expansion is capped by
 * `BACKUP_RESTORE_EXPANDED_LIMIT`, not by the compressed length. So a handful of
 * 1 MiB uploads, each expanding to the whole expanded ceiling, pass upload
 * admission on their small claims and then hold a multiple of that ceiling in
 * decompressed data between them. The wire budget never saw it.
 *
 * A restore's processing peak is dominated by the *expanded* payload and the
 * strings and object graph derived from it -- roughly `PEAK_MULTIPLE` times the
 * expanded limit -- and that figure is independent of how compressible the upload
 * was. This gate caps how many of those can be in flight at once, so the sum stays
 * inside the container. On the default pod the arithmetic yields one: restore
 * processing is serialised, and a second concurrent restore waits for the first to
 * finish rather than being admitted beside it. A restore is a rare, deliberate,
 * destructive operation, so serialising it costs a wait, not a feature.
 *
 * **This gate bounds concurrency, and only concurrency.** What makes one restore
 * fit is the ceiling it is admitted with, and that used to be circular: an earlier
 * version of this comment called the cap insensitive to `PEAK_MULTIPLE`'s true
 * value on the grounds that one restore fitting was already guaranteed by the
 * upload and expanded limits -- while `safeDerivedUploadLimit` *was*
 * `container * share / PEAK_MULTIPLE`. Every ceiling in the chain was derived by
 * dividing by the same unmeasured constant, so none of them could vouch for it.
 *
 * That is now measured and the derivation inverted (issue #1073). The multiple is
 * about 8, not 3 -- the old model handed out a 100 MiB expanded ceiling on the
 * chart's default pod, and four of five 96 MiB artifacts could not be decoded
 * inside the 304 MiB it left free. So `deriveRestoreExpandedLimitBytes` solves the
 * ceiling out of the capacity instead (`(container - baseline) * share /
 * PEAK_MULTIPLE`), which makes one slot the answer by construction on any pod with
 * headroom, and makes `0` the answer where there is none. A bigger pod buys a
 * bigger artifact rather than a second concurrent restore; an operator who wants
 * concurrency lowers `BACKUP_RESTORE_EXPANDED_LIMIT` deliberately.
 *
 * What is still not established: the measurement covers the decode phases only, so
 * the multiple is a lower bound, and no run has been cgroup-constrained -- "refused
 * rather than OOM-killed" rests on the model, not on a demonstration. The margin is
 * `RESTORE_HEADROOM_SHARE`, and `backup-limits.spec.ts` holds the derivation to it.
 *
 * ## The wait is bounded, and a caller who left does not run (DR-F3RB-002)
 *
 * The queue behind the slots used to be a plain array of resolve callbacks: no
 * limit, no deadline, and no removal when the request disconnected -- so a client
 * could hang up while queued and its **destructive** restore still ran when a slot
 * freed, against data the operator may have since changed their mind about. Now:
 *
 * - the queue has a bound (`BACKUP_RESTORE_QUEUE_LIMIT`), and a request arriving
 *   at a full queue is refused with a retryable 503 rather than joining it;
 * - a wait has a deadline (`BACKUP_RESTORE_QUEUE_WAIT_MS`), so nobody waits for a
 *   slot indefinitely holding a socket and an upload reservation;
 * - a waiter whose `AbortSignal` fires leaves the queue and never runs.
 *
 * The asymmetry in `RestoreWaitOptions.signal` is the whole design: cancellation
 * governs the wait and stops at the slot boundary.
 *
 * A module singleton rather than an injectable so the service can reach it without
 * threading it through a constructor that a hundred specs build. `configure(...)`
 * is called once at bootstrap with the real capacity; unconfigured it defaults to
 * one, which is also the safe default a test inherits.

/**
 * How many restores whose combined processing peak fits the container, budgeting
 * against the memory that actually costs and reserving what the process needs.
 *
 * Two things the earlier version got wrong (F3R7-002):
 *
 *  - **The peak is `PEAK_MULTIPLE` times the *resolved* expanded limit**, the one
 *    `gunzip` enforces, not the separately derived default. An operator who raised
 *    `BACKUP_RESTORE_EXPANDED_LIMIT` raised every restore's peak, and the slot
 *    count has to see that or it admits restores that cannot fit.
 *  - **The process baseline is subtracted first.** Dividing the whole container by
 *    the per-restore peak double-counts the memory the ordinary process is already
 *    using.
 *
 * Returns the **honest** count, which can be `0`: a configuration where one modeled
 * restore does not fit is a real condition the caller must surface, not paper over
 * by forcing a slot. `1` for an unknown limit -- "cannot tell how big the pod is"
 * reads as "one at a time".
 *
 * A `0` reaches the gate as zero and `acquire` refuses with a 503 (F3RB-005). This
 * comment used to say the gate raised such a zero back to one, so that a `0` here
 * meant "run one anyway and warn" -- describing the floor that F3RB-005 removed two
 * functions above, which it outlived by several commits.
 *
 * Which containers get that zero moved with the measurement (issue #1073): now it
 * is those with no headroom left after the process baseline -- at or below the
 * baseline's own 140 MiB floor, since a pod above it has *some* headroom and the
 * ceiling derived from it is never rounded up to zero. A 160 MiB pod therefore gets
 * one slot and a ceiling of about 2 MiB, which is honest rather than useful; a
 * 256 MiB pod gets one slot and ~12 MiB, where the old share-based derivation gave
 * it zero -- a smaller promise, kept, instead of a larger one that OOM-killed the
 * pod.
