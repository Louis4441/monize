 *
 * **Who configures it, and whose data it covers.** Only an administrator sees
 * the controls (the endpoints live on `AutoBackupController`, behind
 * `@Roles("admin")`), and what they edit is one **deployment policy**
 * (`AutoBackupPolicy`) rather than their own preference: every active account on

 * **Where the policy is stored.** On the `auto_backup_settings` row of the
 * deployment's primary administrator, the earliest-created active account
 * holding `BACKUP_ADMIN_ROLE` (`resolvePolicyUserId`). That row is a real user's
 * row -- it is also how *their* backups run -- and it is the single row the
 * admin endpoints read and write, whichever administrator is signed in, so two
 * administrators edit one policy rather than two. A deployment with no active
