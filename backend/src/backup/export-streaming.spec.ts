/**
 * What issue #1070 actually claimed, tested as ordering rather than as bytes.
 *
 * The claim is that peak memory tracks the chunk size rather than the dataset,
 * and the only honest way to measure that is the cgroup peak-RSS harness this
 * repository does not have. What a unit test *can* prove is the property the
 * claim rests on: the export never has the whole of anything in hand. Every case
 * below fails against the old implementation, which read each table with one
 * `manager.query`, base64-encoded every attachment into one array before
 * serialising, and produced one `JSON.stringify` per table.
