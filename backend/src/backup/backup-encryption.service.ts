 * that password in plaintext is when they type it -- so it is captured there
 * (`rememberLoginPassword`, called on registration, login and password change)
 * rather than being a password they have to invent and remember separately.
 *
 * That capture is opportunistic, and opportunistic is not the same as reliable:
 * a user who was already signed in when the feature shipped never types their
 * password again, and their backups stay in plaintext for as long as their
 * session lives. So Settings offers local accounts one control --
 * `enableWithLoginPassword`, which asks them to confirm the login password they
 * already have and captures it on the spot (issue #1269). It is the same
 * password, so it neither invents a second secret nor conflicts with the next
 * sign-in.
 *
 * An OIDC account has no password of ours to capture, so nothing can be
 * automatic: those users set a dedicated backup password in Settings
 * (`setBackupPasswordForOidcUser`), or leave their backups unencrypted. The
 * dedicated-password methods refuse a local-auth account rather than pretending
 * -- a local user who "disabled" encryption would have it back at their next
 * login, because that is where the copy is captured.
 *
 * Storage shape: `users.backup_password_enc` holds the password ciphertext
 * written by `BackupPasswordCipher`, and `backup_encryption_enabled` records
 * that a usable copy is there.
