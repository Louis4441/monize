 * with nobody present, and wrapped under the password that opens the user's
 * backups (`backup_key_wrap`), which every automatic backup carries in its
 * header so the file opens with that password alone. The server never stores
 * the password, nor anything that decrypts to it.
 *
 * For a local-auth account there is nothing to configure. The wrap is made
 * under the login password at the moments the server sees it in plaintext --
 * registration, login and password change (`rewrapBackupKey`) -- and is bound to
 * the password hash it was made for (`backup_key_password_ref`), so a password
 * changed by a path that did not re-wrap (a reset link, an admin, an emergency
 * claim) makes the wrap visibly stale rather than silently wrong. Settings also
 * offers local accounts `enableWithLoginPassword`, which asks them to confirm
 * the login password so a session older than the feature can turn it on without
 * signing out (issue #1269).
 *
 * An OIDC account has no password of ours, so those users set a dedicated
 * backup password in Settings (`setBackupPasswordForOidcUser`), or leave their
 * backups unencrypted. The dedicated-password methods refuse a local-auth
 * account rather than pretending -- a local user who "disabled" encryption would
 * have it back at their next login.
 *
 * `users.backup_password_enc` is the retired shape: a recoverable copy of the
 * password itself. Nothing writes it; each remaining row is converted to a
 * wrapped key, and the column cleared, at the next sign-in or the next
