/**
 * Its own controller rather than a route on `InvestmentReportsController`:
 * that one is CRUD over saved reports and owns `GET /reports/investment/:id`,
 * which any sibling literal path would have to be declared ahead of.
 *
 * A delegate reaches this GET under the `reports` section, as every read-only
 * report route does, while the rows it summarizes come from
 * `GET /investment-transactions` under the `investments` section. The two
 * grants are deliberately separate -- each route takes its own subject area's
 * section -- so a delegate holding `reports` but not `investments` sees the
 * KPI cards over a table the API gives them no rows for. That is the section
 * grants speaking, not a figure about somebody else's portfolio: both routes
 * read the owner's rows under the owner's identity, and the summary answers
 * over exactly the row set the list route would return.
