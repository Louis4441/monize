/**
 * The KPIs above the Investment Transaction History report, computed over the

 *
 * Two things this fixes, both of which made the "Total volume" card untrue
 * (issue #1394). The client used to add `total_amount` across rows whose
 * amounts are in the SECURITY's currency -- a EUR 1,000 trade and a USD 1,000
 * trade came out as 2,000 of the reader's money. And it added only the rows it
 * had fetched, stopping at a fixed number of pages, so a large filter produced
 * a confident number for part of the data.
 *
 * Here each row is converted at the rate that stood on its own transaction date
 * (today's rate answers today's question, not the trade's) and accumulated
 * through `FxAggregate`, so a missing pair withholds the total and names itself
 * rather than quietly shrinking the figure.
 *
 * The row set is exactly the one the report's table lists -- `findAll`'s,
 * including VOID rows and excluding a redemption's accrued-interest companion
 * -- so the count on the card and the rows underneath it are the same rows.
