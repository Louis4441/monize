/**
 * Bulk writers for `SP` price history and `CRNC_EXCHG` exchange rates.
 *
 * Both are additive inserts on the natural key the table is already unique on,
 * so importing the same file twice, or importing on top of prices a quote
 * provider fetched, converges rather than failing or duplicating. They differ on
 * a conflict, because the two tables have different owners:
 *
 * - `security_prices` hangs off the importing user's own securities, so the
 *   Money file wins: the user asked to import it, and its history is the one
 *   their transactions were entered against.
 * - `exchange_rates` is global reference data every user on the deployment
 *   converts through, so an existing observation wins and the Money row only
 *   fills a date nothing else holds (INV-FX-004). One user's file must not
 *   rewrite the rate another user's history is valued at.
 *
 * These are the two biggest tables in a real file -- the maintainer's Money Plus
 * file has 68,000 price rows -- so they go in as multi-row `INSERT ... ON
 * CONFLICT` statements with a smaller chunk than the transaction writer uses,
 * because each row binds more parameters.
 *
 * A rate row is oriented by `canonicalRateRow` before it is written, because
 * `exchange_rates` stores each pair once and Money records whichever direction
 * the user entered (INV-FX-003).
