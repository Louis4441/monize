/**
 * Filling a series' own exchange-rate gaps from the provider, on the read path.
 *
 * The daily refresh writes today only, and `backfillHistoricalRates` skips a
 * pair the moment it holds any row at all, so a user who added a EUR holding in
 * June has no EUR->PLN observation for January through June and every point of
 * "Portfolio value over time" in that span reports the pair as missing. The
 * rates exist at the provider; nobody ever asked for them. This module is what
 * asks, on behalf of a series that has just discovered it cannot answer.
 *
 * Two rules shape it, and both are the reason it is a planner rather than a
 * loop over dates:
 *
 * - **A fetch unit is a calendar month, not a day.** One
 *   `ExchangeRateService.ensureRatesForDate` call fetches the whole calendar
 *   month around the date it is given and persists both directions, so a
 *   400-point daily chart needs at most one call per (month, pair), not four
 *   hundred. Any date inside the month selects the same window; the planner
 *   picks the earliest one it saw so the unit is deterministic.
 * - **A fetch is bounded.** `MAX_FILL_MONTHS` months per request, newest first:
 *   a chart asked for "all time" over a twenty-year history must not turn one
 *   GET into two hundred provider calls. What the cap leaves out stays missing,
 *   and the report names it the same way it named everything else it could not
 *   convert -- the point of this module is to answer more questions, never to
 *   invent an answer (INV-FX-001, `docs/time-series-contract.md` section 2).
 *
 * The caller re-reads the rate index from the database afterwards rather than
 * patching what it holds in memory, so what the series converts with is exactly
 * what a second request would find: one source of truth, not two that agree
 * today. `accounts/account-balances-report.service.ts` `ratesForReport` is the
 * same shape for a point-in-time report.
 */

/**

 * - **Best-effort.** A provider failure leaves the series exactly as the first
 *     computation produced it; the request never fails because of the fill.
 *
 * It runs outside any transaction: the callers' reads open and close one per
