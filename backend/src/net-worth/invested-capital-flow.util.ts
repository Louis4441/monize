/**
 * What crossed the boundary of the INVESTED part, per day and per currency.
 *
 * The sibling of `external-flow.util.ts`, drawn around a different boundary.
 * That one asks "did cash cross the edge of the portfolio", so a BUY, a SELL
 * and a DIVIDEND are internal to it. This one asks "did value enter or leave
 * the securities", so those same rows ARE the flows: a purchase moves a
 * reader's cash into the invested part and is not a gain, a sale moves it out
 * and is not a loss, and a distribution is what the invested part earned.
 * `docs/specs/portfolio-period-result.md` section 10.2 is the definition.
 *
 * Three rules this file exists to keep:
 *
 * - **The action classification is not restated here.** Which action is
 *   capital in, capital out, income or nothing is `INVESTED_FLOW_KIND_BY_BASE_ACTION`
 *   (`securities/investment-replay.util.ts`), checked against the enum by a
 *   spec. The SQL groups by raw action and the fold below asks that constant,
 *   so a new action cannot become a silent zero in a capital flow.
 * - **Rows as effects.** A VOID investment transaction moved no shares and no
 *   value, through the shared predicate (`investmentEffectStatusSql`).
 * - **Each day at its own rate.** A row is recorded in its security's currency
 *   and converted at the rate that stood on its own day, through the same
 *   `RateIndex` the value series and the external-flow fold use (INV-FX-001).
 *   A day that would not convert makes that day incomplete, which withholds the
 *   period's figures rather than shrinking them.
