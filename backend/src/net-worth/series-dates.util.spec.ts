/**
 * The implementation this replaces, written out so the regression below can
 * show what it did rather than assert what it did. `new Date("2026-06-01T00:00:00")`
 * is LOCAL midnight; `offsetMinutes` is the process zone's offset east of UTC
 * (Europe/Warsaw in summer is +120), so the instant is that many minutes before
 * UTC midnight and `toISOString()` reads the day before.
 *
 * Simulated rather than run under a real `TZ`, because Node caches the zone at
 * first use and a spec that changes `process.env.TZ` mid-run proves nothing
 * about the process CI actually uses.
