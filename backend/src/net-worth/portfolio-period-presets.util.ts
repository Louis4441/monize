/**
 * The trailing windows the Investments page reports a portfolio result over,
 * and where each one starts.
 *
 * The dates are the client's own range arithmetic moved to the server, so the
 * batch route answers exactly what one call to the single-range route per
 * window would have: `frontend/src/lib/date-range.ts` resolves `1w` as seven
 * days back, `1m` as thirty days, `3m` as ninety, `1y` as the same day a year
 * earlier, `2y` as seven hundred and thirty days back and `5y` as the same day
 * five years earlier, and
 * `frontend/src/components/investments/portfolio-change-baseline.ts`
 * decides which of them measure from the previous close instead of from their
 * first point. `1d` and `10y` are the windows with no client counterpart: a
 * day's move IS the prior close against the newest one, so its window is the
 * end day alone, and `10y` follows `5y`'s same-day-N-years-earlier arithmetic.
 *
 * `ytd` is not the client's January 1: it opens on 31 December of the previous
 * year, so the year is measured from the close of its last trading session,
 * as every quote source reports it and as the charts' own YTD window
 * (`frontend/src/components/investments/portfolio-range-window.ts`) draws it.
 * A day is valued from the latest close on or before it, so a 31 December that
 * fell on a weekend or holiday still carries the last session's close, and
 * `startPriceDate` names that session.
 *
 * `all` is the one window whose start no arithmetic answers: it opens on the
 * day the scope's own history begins, which only a query knows, so
 * `presetWindowStart` returns `null` for it and the caller that HAS that date
 * supplies it (`PortfolioPeriodResultService.firstInvestmentDate`).
 *
 * Every function here is pure and takes "today" as a string, because the server
 * decides what today is (`todayYMD`) and a window must not depend on the clock
 * of whoever asked.
