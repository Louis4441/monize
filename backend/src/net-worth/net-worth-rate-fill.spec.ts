/**
 * The read-path FX fill, at the service seam.
 *
 * `series-rate-fill.spec.ts` covers the plan; this covers what the series does
 * with it: that a gap reaches the provider once per month-pair unit, that a
 * fill which stored rows makes the point complete because the index was
 * RE-READ from the database, and that every way the fill can come back empty --
 * nothing stored, a throw, an opt-out -- leaves the report exactly as honest as
 * it was, with the pair still named.
 *
 * The fixture is the issue's reproduction (#1390): a EUR cash sleeve reported
 * in PLN over a window the exchange_rates table has no row for at all.
