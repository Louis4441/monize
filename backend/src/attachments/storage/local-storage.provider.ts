/**
 * Stores attachment bytes on the local filesystem under ATTACHMENT_LOCAL_DIR,
 * one file per attachment named by its `key` (the attachment id). Chosen by
 * ATTACHMENT_STORAGE_PROVIDER=local -- a zero-dependency alternative to Postgres
 * BYTEA for deployments that would rather keep large blobs off the database
 * (e.g. a mounted volume) without running object storage.
 *
 * Files are fanned out into two levels of subdirectory keyed by the first four
 * hex characters of the id (`<ab>/<cd>/<id>`) rather than dumped flat into a
 * single directory. A flat layout piles every attachment into one directory,
 * and a directory with tens of thousands of entries stalls on filesystems that
 * scan it linearly (ext3) or reach it over the network (NFS/CIFS/overlay):
 * enumeration by backups, rsync and `ls` degrades even where individual
 * lookups stay fast. Two hex bytes give 65536 buckets, so a directory only
 * approaches the ~10k-entry danger zone past hundreds of millions of
 * attachments; the ids are random UUIDs, so the spread is even for free.
 *
 * Bytes live outside the database, so they are not embedded in the application
 * backup; only the metadata row travels with a backup and the directory must be
 * backed up alongside it (see .env.example).
