/**
 * Every storage backend this build knows how to address, and which of them is
 * bound for new bytes.
 *
 * `ATTACHMENT_STORAGE_PROVIDER` names where the NEXT attachment is written.
 * `transaction_attachments.storage_provider` names where an EXISTING one's bytes
 * already are. Those were assumed to be the same value, and the download path
 * simply asked the bound provider for the row's key -- so the boot after an
 * operator changed the setting served 404 for every attachment uploaded before
 * it, with the row, the size and the filename all still listed. The bytes were
 * intact the whole time, in a backend this process could still reach.
 *
 * So resolution is per row, through this registry, and relocation
 * (`AttachmentStorageMigrator`) is what eventually makes the two agree again.
 * Both need the same two questions answered -- which provider holds this row's
 * bytes, and can this deployment reach it at all -- which is why they are asked
 * in one place rather than by each caller with its own `if` on a name.
 *
 * The class is its own DI token, built by the factory in `attachments.module.ts`
 * beside the one that binds the active provider: a consumer needs the class for
 * its type in any case, so a second name for the same thing would be one more
 * thing to keep in step.
