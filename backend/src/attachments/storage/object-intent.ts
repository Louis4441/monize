/**
 * The protocol for writing attachment bytes nothing references yet.
 *
 * A tombstone row means "these bytes may exist at (provider, key) and nothing
 * references them", which is equally true of an upload in flight and of a
 * metadata row that is gone -- one row shape, one sweeper (audit FV4-003). The
 * three statements here are the writer's half of it, and they are in their own
 * file because there are now two writers: `AttachmentsService.create`, which puts
 * the bytes of a new attachment, and `AttachmentStorageMigrator`, which puts a
 * copy of an existing attachment's bytes in the backend a switch moved to. The
 * fences below are subtle enough that a second hand-rolled copy is the likelier
 * defect than any of the code they guard.
 *
 * The `database` provider never takes an intent: its bytes are a row in
 * `attachment_blobs` that commits and rolls back with the metadata, so there is
 * no window for anything to be orphaned in. That check lives here rather than at
 * each call site, because it is a property of the provider.
 */

/**
 * How long a writer owns the key it is about to write.
 *
 * A *latency* mechanism, not the safety one: it keeps the orphan sweep away from
 * a write that is probably still running, so the fence in `clearObjectIntent`
 * stays a safety net rather than a routine source of failures. Correctness does
 * not depend on the value being right, which is the whole difference from the age
 * check it replaced (audit RV4-002).

 *
 * A `ConflictException`, because a lost race is what happened and retrying is what
 * the client should do. As a bare `Error` this escaped `create` as a 500 carrying
 * an untranslated internal message -- neither of which is true of it. The storage
 * key stays a property rather than going in the message: it is a diagnostic, and
