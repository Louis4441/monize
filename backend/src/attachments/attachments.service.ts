   * Store an uploaded file against a transaction. Validates size, sniffs the
   * real MIME type (never trusting the client), enforces the per-transaction
   * cap, and writes metadata + bytes together.
   *
   * "Together" means different things per provider, and the difference matters:
   * the database provider's blob write joins this transaction and genuinely
   * commits or rolls back with the metadata row, while a local filesystem write
   * or an S3 put cannot. For those, a commit failure after the object is written
   * leaves bytes nothing references.
   *
   * The catch below deletes them, but a catch is not a guarantee: it runs only if
   * this process is still alive. Killed between the put and the commit, the bytes
   * survived with no metadata row -- and therefore no tombstone, so the orphan
   * sweep could not find them either. Undiscoverable is the part that matters:
   * unreferenced bytes nobody can enumerate accumulate forever and no operator
   * can tell they are there (audit FV4-003).
   *
   * So an **upload intent** is committed before a single byte is written: a
   * tombstone for the key this upload is about to use, in its own transaction, so
   * it is durable independently of what happens next. Success deletes it *inside*
   * the metadata transaction, which is what makes the pair atomic -- a commit
   * drops the intent with the row that now owns the bytes, and a rollback keeps
   * it, so the sweeper finds the object whether this process survives or not.
   *
   * That delete is also a **fence**. The intent and the deletion record are the
   * same row shape, and the sweeper cannot tell them apart by age -- nothing bounds
   * an upload to any window, so a stalled put or commit outlives one and the sweep
   * deletes bytes this transaction is about to reference. So the sweeper claims the
   * row before deleting the object, and the clear requires the claim to be absent:
   * one of the two loses, and it is never the case that metadata commits pointing
   * at bytes that are gone (audit RV4-002).
   *
   * The fence settles what *metadata* may commit. It cannot settle what bytes
   * exist, because a put that stalled past its lease can land *after* the sweep
   * deleted the key -- and if this process is then killed before the `catch` below,
   * those bytes are unreferenced with no row left to enumerate them. That is why the
   * sweeper keeps a claimed upload intent for `LATE_WRITE_QUARANTINE_MS` instead of
   * dropping the row with the object: the record outlives the writer, so the next
   * pass deletes the late object and only then retires the row (audit RRV4-002).
