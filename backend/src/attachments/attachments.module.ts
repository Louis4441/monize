/**
 * Transaction attachments. Bytes are stored via the injected storage provider,
 * selected by ATTACHMENT_STORAGE_PROVIDER: "database" (default) keeps bytes in
 * Postgres BYTEA; "local" writes them to a filesystem directory; "s3" stores
 * them in S3-compatible object storage. Entities are auto-registered via the
 * datasource glob, so no forFeature is needed -- the service reads repositories
 * from the withScopedDb EntityManager.
 *
 * That setting decides where the NEXT attachment's bytes go. Where an existing
 * one's bytes are is its own `storage_provider` column, and the two disagree for
 * as long as a switch takes to relocate -- so reads go through
 * `AttachmentStorageRegistry` (the row's backend) rather than the bound provider,
 * and `AttachmentStorageMigrator` moves them across in the background.
