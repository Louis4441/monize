/**
 * Collection of the relay's dead rows.
 *
 * Nothing the relay does depends on this run. A turn past its deadline is
 * already unclaimable and unanswerable -- every statement in `AiRelayService`
 * compares against `expires_at` in the database's clock -- and a card past
 * `expires_at` is already filtered out of the drain. The sweep exists because
 * four tables would otherwise be append-only: a browser that never comes back
 * for its answer, an agent that never returns for its turn, a card nobody
 * approves and a file uploaded with a prompt that was never claimed all leave a
 * row with no later visitor -- and the file leaves bytes behind it.
 *
 * Nothing here reaches outside PostgreSQL, which is why the whole sweep is one
 * transaction: the attachment bytes are a cascading child row rather than an
 * object somebody has to remember to delete afterwards.
 *
 * Idempotent by predicate, so every replica firing this cron
 * (`docs/cron-jobs.md`: they all do, in both cluster modes) touches the same
 * rows and the losers touch none. Deleting late is therefore safe; deleting
 * early would not be, which is why every cutoff is a stored timestamp plus an
 * interval rather than a clock this process holds.
