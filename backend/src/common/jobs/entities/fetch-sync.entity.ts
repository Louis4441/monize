/**
 * One row per outbound market-data fetch job, holding the lease that decides
 * which replica calls the provider this tick.
 *
 * The three fetches (exchange rates, security prices, market indexes) fire on
 * every replica and write idempotent upserts, so the *data* converges however
 * many run. What does not is the cost: N replicas is N times the provider
 * calls, N times the rate-limit budget, and N chances to trip the circuit
 * breaker on a provider that is merely slow.
 *
 * So this is a cost control. A crashed holder must never block the next tick,
 * which is why the lease expires rather than being released by a person, and
 * why `lease_until` is always shorter than the cron's interval.
 *
 * Deployment-wide state with no owner column, so RLS-exempt for the same reason
 * `market_index_sync` is (`backend/src/common/db/rls-exempt-tables.ts`,
 * `docs/row-level-security-contract.md`).
