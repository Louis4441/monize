/**
 * Counts the backend processes connected to this database, so a deployment
 * that asserted `CLUSTER_MODE=single` can notice that it is not alone.
 *
 * Each process stamps its sessions with `application_name =
 * monize-backend:<INSTANCE_ID>@<started>` (`instance-id.ts`), so the number of
 * distinct values in `pg_stat_activity` is the number of processes.
 * `application_name` is readable on every session whatever role opened it (the
 * view masks `backend_start`, `query` and the like on other roles' rows, not
 * the name), and one process counts once however many roles or connections it
 * uses.
 *
 * Only processes that started more than ten minutes ago count, so the brief
 * overlap of a rolling deployment -- old and new pod both connected while
 * traffic moves -- is not read as two replicas. The age is the process's, from
 * the name, not the session's `backend_start`: the pool closes a connection
 * idle for ten seconds, so a session of a quiet replica is never ten minutes
 * old, and `backend_start` is masked on another role's rows anyway.
 *
 * A peer is visible only while it holds a connection, which an idle pool does
 * not. The system-alert sweep runs on the same wall-clock schedule on every
 * replica, so their sessions overlap at the moment it asks; the count still
 * errs towards "one" and never invents a peer.
 *
 * A census, not a lock: it answers "how many right now", races with every
 * process starting and stopping, and drives only a warning and a health field.
 * Nothing may be decided from it.
 *
 * `pg_stat_activity` is a system view with no owner column, and the callers are
 * a cron and the health endpoint, neither of which carries a user identity --
 * so the read seeds a system context, and this file is on
 * `WITH_CONTEXT_ALLOWLIST`.
