/**
 * What this process needs in order to be one replica of several.
 *
 * Two providers, the shape of `DemoModeModule`: the parsed `CLUSTER_MODE`, and
 * the `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY` connection -- `null` in `single`, where the only
 * subscriber is in the publishing process and there is nothing to wake.
 *
 * `@Global()` and imported only by `AppModule`. The listener is reached from
 * the event bus, from readiness, and later from anything else that has to wake
 * a waiter; a module edge from each of those is a require cycle waiting to
 * happen, which `module-graph.spec.ts` fails.
 *
 * The factory opens no socket. Connecting happens in `main.ts`, before
 * `app.listen`, so a database host that cannot hold a `LISTEN` is one line in
 * the log rather than a bootstrap rejection with the cause buried in a stack
 * trace -- the same reasoning as the role and schema checks beside it.
