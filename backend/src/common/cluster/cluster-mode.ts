/**
 * Cluster runtime mode: how many replicas of this process are expected to serve
 * one database.
 *
 *   - `single` : the default, and today's behaviour byte-for-byte. One replica.
 *                In-process state (throttler counters, the AI relay's live
 *                promises) is correct because there is only one process.
 *   - `multi`  : several replicas behind a load balancer with no session
 *                affinity. Anything a second replica would get wrong must be a
 *                row, so the mode is a precondition the boot checks rather
 *                than a hint. PostgreSQL is the only shared store: the
 *                throttler's counters are a table and the cross-replica
 *                wake-up is `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY`, so `multi` adds no dependency
 *                and no connection setting of its own.
 *
 * The parse-and-throw shape is `parseRlsMode` in `backend/src/common/db/rls-config.ts`: an
 * unrecognized value refuses the boot instead of silently falling back to a
 * mode the operator did not ask for.
 *
 * See `docs/future-plans/horizontal-scaling.md` for the work this gates.

 * is required for an `s3` store and the store says so on its first use, with a
