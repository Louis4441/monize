/**
 * The one door between the stored exchange-rate history and "the rate for this
 * date".
 *
 * Four resolvers used to answer this question -- the chart index, the posting
 * ladder, the intraday portfolio index and the investment report -- and they
 * disagreed on every part of it: whether a rate from *after* the valuation date
 * may be used, how old a carried-forward rate may be, whether an inverse
 * observation is consulted when a direct one exists, and whether the answer for
 * a date depends on how wide the surrounding window happened to be. One session
 * could therefore quote four different EUR rates.
 *
 * The rules this module holds, none of which a caller may restate:
 *
 *  - **Never look ahead.** In `historical` mode the answer is the most recent
 *    observation dated on or *before* the date being priced. An observation
 *    struck after that date did not exist when the date happened, so it is not
 *    evidence about it, however close it is.
 *  - **A carried-forward rate has a maximum age** (`FX_MAX_RATE_AGE_DAYS`).
 *    Beyond it the date's rate is unknown, not "the last one we have":
 *    `docs/time-series-contract.md` section 2.2 -- an exchange rate is a price,
 *    and a nine-month-old price does not describe today.
 *  - **The more recent admissible observation wins**, whichever direction it is
 *    stored in; a tie goes to the direct pair. An old direct row must not block
 *    a fresh inverse one, and the choice must not depend on map iteration order.
 *  - **Rate 1 only for equal codes**, and only without a lookup. A missing code
 *    is unknown, never 1 (INV-FX-001).
 *  - **A non-positive stored rate is absent**, not applicable: multiplying by 0
 *    reports a real holding as worthless.
 *  - **An unknown answer names its cause**, so a surface can tell "this pair was
 *    never observed" from "your history has a 285-day hole".
 *
 * `live` mode is the current-rate path: it may take the freshest observation
 * rather than one dated on or before the reference date, under the same age
 * bound. It is still not a licence to use a year-old rate.

 * of ~9,700 days against an index holding ~9,700 rows per direction, so the

 * one direction are the same day's observation and the first is kept") is
 * position 0 of the run rather than a scan's first sighting. Only rows the scan
 * would have considered at all are kept -- a non-finite, zero or negative rate
 * is absent, and so is an empty date -- so `dates.length > 0` is exactly the
 * scan's `sawAnyObservation`.

 * series builds lives for one request and its arrays are never mutated, so the
 * preparation is a per-array memo with no lifetime of its own. `sourceLength`
