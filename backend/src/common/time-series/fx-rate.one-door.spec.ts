 * `docs/time-series-contract.md` section 2.2: an exchange rate is a price, so
 * turning a stored rate into "the rate for this date" goes through the shared
 * helper that applies the age bound and refuses look-ahead --
 * `common/time-series/fx-rate-resolver.ts`, reached either directly or through
 * `ExchangeRateService.resolveStoredRate` / `getRateForDate`.
 *
 * Issue #1390 is what this guard exists for: four resolvers answered the same
 * question and disagreed, so one session quoted four different EUR rates. The
 * prose form of that rule cannot see a fifth being added, and each of the four
 * looked perfectly reasonable in its own file.
 *
 * What it looks for: a read of the *newest* stored rate -- `getLatestRate(`,
 * or a `rate_date` ordered descending beside a one-row fetch -- outside the
 * door. `getLatestRates()` (the plural admin listing) is not that and is not
 * flagged.
 *
 * The baseline is **shrink-only**. Every entry is a call site that predates the
 * guard, with the reason it is still there; a new one fails the build, and
 * fixing one means deleting its line here in the same change.

 * the user rather than presenting it as that date's rate.
 *
 * `currencies/exchange-rate.service.ts` is deliberately **not** here. It is the
