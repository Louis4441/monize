/**
 * The instruction files are read on every task, so their size is a cost every
 * task pays. `frontend/CLAUDE.md` was compacted once (PR 1245) and grew back to
 * 188 KB, because each rule brought the defect it came from, the reasoning and
 * the guard along with it; the fix was to make the layer files indexes over
 * `docs/frontend/` and `docs/backend/`, where a rule is read only when the work
 * touches its subject, and to give the root file the same treatment. The root
 * `CLAUDE.md` says how the files are organised; `AGENTS.md` is the tool-agnostic
 * entry point. Prose about file size is exactly the kind of rule that gets read,
 * agreed with and violated one paragraph at a time, so this is the version the
 * machine checks:
 *
 *  - every instruction file stays under its ceiling: `INSTRUCTION_FILE_MAX_BYTES`
 *    for the root and layer `CLAUDE.md` files, `AGENTS_FILE_MAX_BYTES` for
 *    `AGENTS.md`, which also carries the commands and the gate. Lower a ceiling
 *    as a file shrinks; never raise one to admit a paragraph;
 *  - every document under `docs/frontend/` and `docs/backend/` is named in its
 *    layer index, so a rule cannot be filed where no reader is sent;
 *  - no instruction file carries an issue or PR number: that is the marker of a
 *    defect history, which belongs in the `docs/` entry beside the rule.
 *
 * The inventory comes from `git ls-files`, so a new document under either
 * directory is covered once it is staged.
