/**
 * Which transaction rows are an investment movement rather than ordinary cash,
 * written once for every reader.
 *
 * An INVESTMENT account in Monize is a PAIR (`accounts.service.ts`
 * `createInvestmentAccountPair`): an `INVESTMENT_CASH` sleeve holding real
 * money and an `INVESTMENT_BROKERAGE` sleeve holding securities, both carrying
 * `account_type = 'INVESTMENT'`. So `account_type != 'INVESTMENT'` is not a
 * filter on synthetic rows -- it deletes the cash sleeve's entire ledger,
 * salary deposits included (issue #1257).
 *
 * Two layers, and neither substitutes for the other:
 *
 *  - `accountSubType != 'INVESTMENT_BROKERAGE'` keeps the securities sleeve's
 *    register out of a cash report. A standalone investment account (subtype
 *    NULL, as .mny imports produce) IS its own cash side, so it stays in.
 *  - `NOT EXISTS (investment_transactions ...)` catches the cash-side rows that
 *    BUY / SELL / DIVIDEND post into the linked cash account
 *    (`createCashTransactionInTransaction`). Those carry no category and no
 *    transfer flag, and the subtype filter cannot see them at all -- untreated
 *    they leak into "spending" and "income" totals as uncategorised money.
 *
 * The split fragment is the same fact one level down: an investment embedded in
 * a split (`transaction_splits.kind = 'investment'`) has `category_id IS NULL`,
 * so a report grouping on `COALESCE(ts.category_id, t.category_id)` files that
 * line under Uncategorized unless it is excluded here.
 *
 * A raw-SQL caller and a QueryBuilder caller need the same predicate spelled
 * with different column names, so both are derived from one definition below
 * rather than written twice.

/**

 *
 * A report that joins `transaction_splits` classifies each line on its own and

 * Recurring Expenses, Bill Payment History, the Uncategorized list -- cannot:
 * `t.amount` on a split parent is the sum of ALL its children, and an embedded
 * investment line's `transaction_id` is null, so the linkage exclusion above
 * cannot see it. Such a query admitted a `-560` parent made of `-60` groceries
 * and a `-500` embedded BUY as `560` of spending (branch audit F-RPT-001).
 *
 * Excluding the whole parent instead is the opposite error -- it loses the `60`
 * the user really did spend -- so the amount is derived at split-row
 * granularity: the sum of the children that are neither a transfer nor an
 * investment.
 *
 * NULL means "this row represents no ordinary cash at all" (a pure investment or
 * transfer passthrough). Every arithmetic comparison against NULL is NULL, which
 * a WHERE clause reads as false, so a caller filtering on `< 0` or `IS NOT NULL`
 * drops those rows without a second predicate. A caller that must keep them --
 * one whose subject is the stored row rather than its cash meaning -- says so.
