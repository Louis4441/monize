/**
 * The cross-replica wake-up channel.
 *
 * **A message on this bus is a hint, never data.** A subscriber's only correct
 * response to one is to go and look at the database; it must never act on the
 * payload itself. Two reasons, and both have teeth:
 *
 * - **The bus can lose a message.** Redis pub/sub is fire-and-forget, a
 *   subscriber reconnecting after a Redis restart misses everything sent while
 *   it was away, and no delivery is acknowledged. A reader that treats a
 *   wake-up as the notification waits forever for one that was dropped, so
 *   every waiter also polls on a slow timer and the wake-up only shortens the
 *   wait.
 * - **The bus carries no transaction and no identity.** A publish is not
 *   rolled back by the transaction that triggered it, so it is issued **after**
 *   commit -- publishing inside one wakes a reader to a row that may never
 *   exist. And the payload crosses replicas outside RLS entirely: it never
 *   reaches `withScopedDb`, so nothing decides who may read it. Row ids and
 *   user ids, which the recipient then reads back under its own scope, are the
 *   whole of what belongs here.
 *
 * `MemoryEventBus` is the implementation in `CLUSTER_MODE=single`, where the
 * only subscriber is in the publishing process. `RedisEventBus` (task R6)
 * replaces it in `multi`.
 *
 * `docs/future-plans/horizontal-scaling.md` has the work this supports.
