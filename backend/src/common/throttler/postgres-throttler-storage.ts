 * 10 across two pods, and a rollout hands the next attempt a clean count. Bound
 * only in `CLUSTER_MODE=multi`; `single` keeps the library default, which is
 * correct there and costs no write.
 *
 * This is the cheap first gate, not the correctness gate. Every authentication
 * route also carries `auth_attempt_counters` beneath it (task A2), which is a
 * logged table and a deliberate refusal. That is what makes failing **open**
 * here the right trade: a database blip would otherwise turn every guarded
 * request into a 500 raised before the handler decides anything, and readiness
 * already removes a replica that has lost its database.

   * what `ThrottlerGuard` puts in the `Retry-After` header. Both conversions
   * are against the database's own clock, never this process's: two replicas
   * whose clocks differ by a second must not disagree about whether a window
   * has passed.
   *
   * One statement, because the count a caller compares against the limit has to
   * be the count the database wrote. A read-then-write would let two replicas
   * each see "4 of 5" and both allow the fifth.
   *
   * The three `CASE` expressions repeat the same guard sequence because a `SET`
   * list cannot read the value it is assigning, so "what are the hits now" has
   * to be spelled once per column. The sequence, in order:
   *
   *  1. **blocked and still serving it** -- nothing moves. Matching the
   *     library, a blocked key stops accumulating, so hammering through a block
   *     does not extend it.
   *  2. **blocked but the block has lapsed** -- a fresh window at one hit, the
   *     block cleared. The library resets the count here too.
   *  3. **window expired** -- a fresh window at one hit.
   *  4. **otherwise** -- one more hit in the live window, and the block is set
   *     if that hit passed the limit.
   *
   * **The window is fixed, not sliding, and that is a deliberate difference
   * from the storage this replaces.** `@nestjs/throttler`'s in-memory storage
   * schedules a timer per hit that decrements the count `ttl` later, so it
   * never allows more than `limit` in any sliding window. This resets the whole
   * count when the window passes, which admits up to `2 x limit` across a
   * boundary: five registrations at 14:59 and five more at 15:01 against a
   * 15-minute, 5-request cap. The trade is deliberate -- it is the same fixed
   * window `auth_attempt_counters` uses, it needs no per-hit row, and at two or
   * more replicas it is still strictly tighter than the `limit x replicas` the
   * in-memory storage gives -- but it is a weakening at one replica and is
   * named here rather than left for a reader to discover. The auth routes carry
   * `auth_attempt_counters` and `users.locked_until` beneath them;
   * `register`, `oauth/interaction`, `pat` and the `ai/*` spend limits do not.
