   * Self-service reset of an exposed or unusable authenticator: clear the TOTP
   * secret (active and pending), the backup codes and the enabled flag, and
   * every trusted device, so the user can enroll a new authenticator at once.
   *
   * Allowed under `FORCE_2FA`, which is the point: disabling is refused there,
   * so without this a user whose authenticator leaked, or whose secret the
   * server can no longer decrypt (a changed `JWT_SECRET`), needed an
   * administrator. The forced-enrolment redirect then sends them straight back
   * into setup.
   *
   * It takes both proofs -- the account password and a second factor -- and
   * never one alone: a 6-digit authenticator code or one backup code, as sign-in
   * accepts. There is deliberately no password-only path, not even when the
   * TOTP secret is undecryptable: a stolen session plus a phished or reused
   * password must not be enough to strip the second factor. With an
   * undecryptable secret a 6-digit code is simply an invalid code (counted), and
   * a backup code -- bcrypt-hashed, independent of `JWT_SECRET` -- still works.
   * A user with neither needs the administrator reset.
   *
   * Every failure, password or code, draws on the same per-user TOTP budget as
   * sign-in and the other management endpoints (`assertManagementTotpBudget`),
   * so a stolen session cannot guess either through this route. The checks run
   * inside the transaction that clears the secret, against the row locked for
   * update, so a refused request has written nothing and a concurrent enrolment
   * cannot interleave; the failure is counted after that transaction, because a
   * counter joined to it would roll back with the refusal.
   *
   * Only the refresh-token families other than `currentRefreshToken`'s are
   * revoked, after the commit (`TokenService.revokeAllUserRefreshTokens`
   * converges over several transactions of its own): a session the exposed
   * factor may have admitted ends, while the one asking stays signed in to
   * enroll. Personal access tokens and OAuth grants are left alone; they never
   * passed a second factor, so replacing it does not bear on them, and the
   * password is unchanged.
