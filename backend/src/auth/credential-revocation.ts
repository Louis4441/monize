 * What a replaced password takes with it.

 * Every path that sets a password because the old one may be known to someone
 * else -- the emailed reset link, a change from settings, an admin or owner
 * reset, an emergency-access claim -- and the confirmation of an OIDC account
 * link must end every credential the old holder could still use. Revoking only
 * the web sessions left a personal access token or an MCP client's OAuth grant
 * working for whoever held it, which is the access a reset exists to cut.
 *
 * Four kinds of credential, revoked in two places:
 *
 * 1. **Inside the password write's transaction** (`revokeStandingCredentials`):
 *    personal access tokens and trusted devices. They are ordinary rows under
 *    `withScopedDb`, so they commit or roll back with the new password -- a
 *    refused reset revokes nothing, and a committed one cannot leave them live.
 * 2. **After that commit**: refresh tokens, through each path's existing
 *    mechanism (`TokenService.revokeAllUserRefreshTokens` converges across
 *    several transactions and must not be nested), and the OAuth provider's
 *    grants and tokens (`revokeOAuthGrantsAfterCommit`), which live in the
 *    provider's own store and are reached only through
 *    `OAuthProviderService.revokeAllForUser`. A failure there is logged at
 *    `error` with the account id and rethrown: the password has changed, so the
 *    caller must not report a clean success, and the log line is what makes the
 *    leftover grant alertable.
