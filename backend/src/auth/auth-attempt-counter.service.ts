/**
 * How a further failure inside a live window treats the window's end.
 *
 * The two shapes are different security controls, and the one that suits a
 * per-email send throttle silently weakens a lockout counter -- so the call
 * site spells it and there is no safe default to fall into.
 *
 * - `fixed` -- the first attempt sets the end and nothing moves it, so N
 *   attempts are allowed per window however they are spaced. What the
 *   forgot-password and resend-verification throttles have always done; their
 *   `windowStart` field was never pushed out by a refused send.
 * - `sliding` -- every attempt pushes the end out, so a count only lapses after
 *   a full quiet window. What the 2FA and step-up limiters did as `Map`
 *   entries, each of which wrote `expiresAt: Date.now() + window` on *every*
 *   failure. It is the stronger control: under `fixed`, an attacker pacing
 *   themselves at one attempt per window never accumulates, so the tenth
 *   failure that writes `users.locked_until` is never reached.

/**
 * Every rate-limit and lockout counter the auth layer keeps, on rows.
 *
 * What this replaces was a `Map` per limiter per process. That is two defects
 * wearing one field: two replicas enforce "three attempts" twice, and a restart
 * -- a rollout, a crash, an OOM kill -- hands an attacker a fresh allowance for
 * free. A row fixes both, because the increment below is one statement and the
 * database decides the order.
 *
 * Scopes and keys are the contract between replicas: two processes must spell a
 * limiter the same way or they are counting different things. Callers pass a
 * literal scope and a key that is already opaque -- `sha256(email)`,
 * `sha256(tempToken)`, a user id. Never the secret itself: this table has no
 * owner column and is RLS-exempt, so a raw key would be readable by every
 * session (`docs/row-level-security-contract.md`).

   * Count one failure and return the window's running total.
   *
   * One statement, so the count a caller compares against its threshold is the
   * count the database wrote, not a read another replica has already
   * invalidated. An expired window is reset in place rather than deleted: a row
   * past `window_expires_at` restarts at 1 and moves its window, which is what
   * makes the daily sweep (`AuthStateSweeperService`) a collection of garbage
   * and never a part of the limit.
   *
   * `window` decides what a further failure does to a window that is still
   * live, and the caller must say which control it is running -- see
   * `AttemptWindow`. Getting it wrong does not fail: it quietly turns a lockout
   * into a rate limit.
   *
   * **It runs outside the caller's transaction, deliberately.** A failure
   * counter exists to be recorded on the path that then *refuses* the request,
   * and a refusal usually throws -- so an increment joined to the caller's
   * transaction would roll back with it, and the limiter would count every
   * attempt as zero. `runOutsideActiveScopedManager` gives this statement its
   * own connection and its own commit; with no ambient transaction (the login
   * and 2FA paths have none) it is a no-op. The cost is one pooled connection
   * for the length of one statement, on a path that is already failing.
