 * start runs to that same day. The class-validator decorators have already
 * established that whatever IS present is a real calendar date; what they
 * cannot see is the route parameter, which is why the three rules that involve
 * it are here rather than on the DTO.
 *
 * The anchor must fall inside the span. The panel that sent the save is showing
 * that day, and a span that skips it would store a note the reader is told they
 * just wrote and cannot see -- the save would succeed and the surface would go
 * back to "Add a note".
