/**
 * A user's own notes on calendar dates.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT `@AllowDelegate`: a note is the owner's own writing about
 * their own day, and sharing it with a delegate is a separate product decision
 * nobody has made (design decision 12). A delegate acting for an owner sees no
 * note surface at all, which is why there is no read arm here either -- an
 * endpoint a delegate could read would make the client's hiding of the section
 * the only thing keeping it private.
 *
 * `userId` comes from the JWT on every route and is never read from the request.
