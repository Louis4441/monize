/**
 * Watches for deployment states nobody currently reports and raises them as
 * admin system alerts:
 *
 * - **Weak `JWT_SECRET`** (a published placeholder or a typed pattern that
 *   is long enough to boot), re-raised once per ISO week while it stays. The
 *   startup log warning in `main.ts` stays; this is the in-app copy an
 *   operator who never reads container logs actually sees, and the admin
 *   banner (`GET /admin/deployment-status`) is the third.
 *
 *   The missing-`ENCRYPTION_KEY` alert this sweep used to raise is gone: the
 *   server now refuses to start without a key (`checkClusterBoot`), so the
 *   state cannot be observed from a running process. The
 *   `ENCRYPTION_KEY_MISSING` type stays for the rows already raised.
 *
 *   Deliberately on the sweep rather than on `onApplicationBootstrap`, for
 *   three reasons that all bit the boot-time version: a fresh install has no
 *   administrator yet when it boots, so the fan-out stood down and the alert
 *   was never raised until somebody restarted the server; a deployment that
 *   simply keeps running never re-raised it, contradicting the weekly bucket
 *   it is keyed on; and Nest awaits bootstrap hooks inside `app.listen()`, so
 *   an unreachable relay delayed the port opening by one SMTP timeout per
 *   administrator and could hold a readiness probe into a restart loop. A
 *   condition that has been true since installation can wait fifteen minutes.
 * - **SMTP delivery failing**: a 15-minute sweep over this replica's own
 *   `EmailService` failure snapshot, confirmed by a live probe. The sweep is
 *   per replica by construction -- the snapshot is in-process memory with no
 *   durable home -- so a recorded failure is only a reason to look: before
 *   raising, the sweep calls `EmailService.verifyConnection()` (a connect,
 *   TLS and login without a message; production code never called it before
 *   this sweep) and raises only when that probe fails too. "Failing" then
 *   means "this replica cannot reach the relay now", which is true and
 *   actionable under any number of replicas; a stale memory of one failed
 *   send on one replica, after SMTP recovered and the others kept sending,
 *   no longer raises it for the whole deployment. A replica with no failure
 *   recorded is never probed. In-app only by definition -- the email channel
 *   cannot report itself. Skipped entirely when SMTP is not configured:
 *   unconfigured is a setup state announced at boot, not a failure.
 * - **More than one backend process under `CLUSTER_MODE=single`**: the mode is
 *   an operator's assertion, and a second replica started without the flag (a
 *   compose file scaled up, a bare Kubernetes Deployment) runs with rate limits
 *   and cache invalidation that are per process, silently. The sweep asks
 *   `ReplicaCensusService` how many backend processes, each running for over
 *   ten minutes, hold a session on this database, and logs a warning naming
 *   `CLUSTER_MODE=multi` when it is more than one. A log line and the
 *   `replicas` field of `/health`, not an admin alert: it is an operator's
 *   configuration, and no new notification type exists for it. Nothing in
 *   `multi`, which already handles peers.
 *
 * No database access of its own -- `SystemAlertService` and
 * `ReplicaCensusService` seed their own RLS context -- so this file does not
 * need the with-context lint allowlist.
