/**
 * An `AuthAttemptCounterService` double backed by a `Map`.
 *
 * The limiter it replaces *is* the behaviour several auth specs assert ("three
 * wrong codes and the fourth is refused before verification"), so a double that
 * only records calls would take those assertions with it. This one reproduces
 * the statement's semantics instead: count up inside the window, reset to 1 once
 * the window has passed, delete on `reset`. Typed as `jest.Mocked<...>` so `tsc`
 * rejects a shape the real service cannot return.
 *
 * The map is in the *test*, not in the code under test, which is the whole
 * point: it stands in for one shared table, so a spec can also drive the loser
 * path by pre-seeding a count.
