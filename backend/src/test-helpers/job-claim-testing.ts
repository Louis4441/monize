/**
 * A `JobClaimService` double that always wins the claim.
 *
 * Typed as `jest.Mocked<JobClaimService>` rather than
 * `Record<string, jest.Mock>` on purpose: this is one of our own services, so
 * `tsc` should reject a return shape the real method cannot produce. An untyped
 * double here would let a spec assert against fiction -- see the mock rule in
 * `docs/backend/testing.md`.
 *
 * Winning by default keeps the existing behaviour of every cron spec written
 * before the claim existed. A spec that wants the *loser* path -- the one that
 * proves a second replica sends nothing -- sets `claimOnce` to resolve false or
 * `claimLease` to resolve `null`, which is the assertion worth writing.
 *
 * `claimLease` resolves a **token**, not `true`, because that is what the real
 * method returns since DR-RRV4-01: the caller carries it into `release` and
 * `markDelivered` so a stalled attempt cannot write against a lease another replica
 * retook. {@link TEST_LEASE_TOKEN} is that token, so a spec can assert the value
 * travelled rather than merely that a string did.
 *
 * `wasDelivered` defaults to false for the same reason: a lease says a replica may
 * send, and only the delivery record says one did, so the two have to be settable
 * independently or the recovery path cannot be tested at all.
