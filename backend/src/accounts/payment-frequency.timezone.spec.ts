/**
 * A payoff date is the same calendar day in every deployment.
 *
 * CI runs `TZ=UTC` and so does every other spec in this directory, which is
 * exactly why this class of defect survives review: `advancePaymentDates` read
 * LOCAL date components off a `Date` its callers build from a date-only string
 * (`new Date("2026-01-15")` is UTC midnight) and returned a LOCAL-midnight
 * `Date` that `formatDateYMD` then read back in UTC. Every payoff date came out
 * one day early outside UTC, by two different routes -- west of Greenwich the
 * input read landed on the previous day, east of it the output did -- so the
 * linked scheduled transaction's `endDate` fell a day before its own final
 * occurrence and the last payment never posted.
 *
 * The rule the code follows: a `Date` carrying a calendar date is UTC-midnight
 * here, the convention `ensureYMD` and `formatDateYMD` already share.
 *
 * **A same-offset test cannot demonstrate an offset property.** Setting
 * `process.env.TZ` inside a Jest worker does not move `Date` -- the sandbox's
 * `process.env` write never reaches V8's timezone cache, so the whole matrix
 * passes against deliberately broken code (verified). The offsets are therefore
 * walked in child processes, which is the only place `TZ` is read: same family
 * as "a mocked filesystem cannot demonstrate a filesystem property".
 *
 * The source scan below is the cheap generalisation -- it fails for a local
 * getter anywhere in these modules, including at a call site this spec does not
 * exercise.
