 * the subtotal's own date**, or `null` when none is known (and 1 for the
 * reporting currency itself). The date is passed rather than assumed, because a
 * deposit that landed on Saturday is worth Saturday's rate, not the rate of the
 * day the cron happens to run: pricing a whole window's flow at one closing rate
 * invents a movement out of the FX move between the two dates (INV-PORTMOVE-007).
 * A caller with an undated window subtotal receives `null` and decides for
 * itself.
 *
 * Amounts accumulate as integer 1/10000 units and are divided once, so a fold
 * over many days does not drift the way repeated float addition does.
 *
 * Pure so the completeness policy is testable without the rate service or a
 * database.
