 * "what does THIS occurrence cost, and when does it fall" -- the question every
 * bills, budget, report, export, AI and MCP surface actually asks. Centralizing
 * the arithmetic was not enough on its own: each consumer still had to know that
 * the occurrence's identity is `originalDate`, that `overrideDate` moves it, and
 * which member of the resolver's result to read -- and they did not agree.
 *
 * `amount` is `null` exactly when the occurrence's current amount is unknown, and
 * `null` is never a licence to fall back to `ScheduledTransaction.amount`: that
 * scalar is a snapshot taken at whatever FX rate was current when it was written.
 * A consumer renders the occurrence as unavailable and withholds any total
 * containing it.
