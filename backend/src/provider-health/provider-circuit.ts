/**
 * One outbound provider's circuit breaker: the thing that stops a dead upstream
 * from being asked again a thousand times a minute.
 *
 * Issue #1265: Yahoo became unreachable from the container, and every code path
 * that wanted a price kept calling `fetch` anyway. A bootstrap market-index
 * refresh alone is 24 indexes x up to 11 yearly chunks, each waiting out its
 * own timeout and each logging a stack; the register, the dashboard and the
 * chart endpoints added theirs on every render. The result was a log nobody
 * could read, an event loop with hundreds of doomed sockets on it, and a
 * container the operator restarted -- which ran the bootstrap refresh again.
 *
 * The breaker turns "the provider is down" from a per-call discovery into a
 * fact the process holds:
 *
 * - **closed** -- normal. Consecutive transport failures are counted; the
 *   count is reset by any success, because a breaker that counted failures
 *   forever would open on an unrelated blip a week later.
 * - **open** -- `FAILURE_THRESHOLD` consecutive transport failures. No request
 *   leaves the process until the window elapses; callers get
 *   `ProviderUnavailableError` immediately instead of a 10-60s timeout. Each
 *   consecutive open window is twice as long as the last, capped, so an outage
 *   that lasts an hour costs a handful of probes rather than one per minute.
 * - **half-open** -- the window elapsed and exactly one probe is admitted. Its
 *   outcome decides: success closes the breaker and clears the escalation,
 *   failure re-opens it for the next (longer) window. One probe, not a
 *   thundering herd: the whole point is that a still-dead provider costs one
 *   socket per window.
 *
 * Only *transport* failures count (see `isTransportFailure`). An HTTP 404 or a
 * body that will not parse is this request's problem; the server answered.
 *
 * State is per process and deliberately in memory: it describes what *this*
 * replica just experienced with its own sockets and DNS, which is exactly the
 * thing a shared table could not tell it. What is durable is the *notification*
 * state (`provider_health`), so the alert survives the restart loop the outage
 * causes.
