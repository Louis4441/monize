/**
 * How long the wake-up channel may be down before readiness gives up on it.
 *
 * Not zero, and that is the whole point. Every replica's listener session dies
 * at the same instant when the database restarts or fails over, so a probe that
 * failed on the state alone would take every pod out of the Service at once --
 * a total outage of every feature, to avoid at most one poll interval of extra
 * latency on AI-relay turns, which is the only thing a missing wake-up costs
 * (`common/events/event-bus.interface.ts`: the bus is a hint, and every waiter
 * also polls).
 *
 * Comfortably above the reconnect ceiling, so a channel still down after this
 * is one whose reconnect ladder has had several full attempts and is not merely
 * in progress. A genuinely misconfigured replica never reaches here at all:
 * `main.ts` refuses the boot.
