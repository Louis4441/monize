          "Get upcoming scheduled bills and deposits due within a date window. Each item is classified as bill / deposit / transfer / investment / unknown -- `unknown` means the direction could not be derived (an unpriceable mixed-sign split can post either way), so report it as unknown rather than as a bill or a deposit, and it withholds BOTH rollup totals. Each item includes a daysUntilDue value (negative when overdue). Each item is ONE occurrence -- the next one due -- so `nextDueDate` is the date that occurrence actually falls on (a per-occurrence override can move it off the schedule's own recurrence date) and `amount` is what that occurrence would post today in its own `currency`, and is null with `amountComplete` false when the current exchange rate for it cannot be determined -- report such an item as unknown rather than guessing. Both bucket totals (`totalUpcomingBills` / `totalUpcomingDeposits`) are expressed in `totalsCurrency` (the user's default), not in the items' own currencies -- state that code whenever you quote a total, and never sum item `amount` values yourself since they can be in different currencies. A bucket total is null when any item in it has an unknown amount or is in a currency with no rate into `totalsCurrency`, with the partial sum in `knownUpcomingBillsSubtotal` / `knownUpcomingDepositsSubtotal`; quote that only as a subtotal. `amountsComplete` says whether anything is missing, `unknownAmountItems` names the items with no workable amount, and `missingRatePairs` names the currency pairs with no rate. Returns the same shape as the AI Assistant's list_upcoming_bills tool.",
