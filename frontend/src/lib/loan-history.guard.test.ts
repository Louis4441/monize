/**
 * Guard for the rule the audit of PR #1258 turned up: in `lib/loan-history.ts`
 * an **empty list is a claim about the ledger**, not a neutral default.
 *
 * `deriveLoanPaymentHistory` reads an empty `interestTransactions` as "no
 * interest was booked against these payments, so their interest is zero" -- a
 * measured zero that reaches Interest Paid, every cumulative total, the CSV and
 * PDF exports and the projection seed. A `catch` in this module that answers
 * with `[]` (or `0`, or a bare default) turns a timeout, a 500 or a proxy error
 * into exactly that claim, and the user has no way to tell the two apart.
 *
 * So this module does not catch: every failure propagates to the caller, which
 * owns an error-and-retry state (`useReportData` in the three loan reports,
 * `failedAccountId` in `useLoanProjection`, the page-level error on the account
 * detail route). The scan is the whole rule -- there is no legitimate `catch`
 * here, so no baseline to keep.
