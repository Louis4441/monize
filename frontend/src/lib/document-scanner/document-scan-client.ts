 * The main thread's handle on the scanner worker.
 *
 * Two things it owns that the worker cannot. First, request identity: a scan
 * takes seconds, a user can retake a photo or drag a corner while one is in
 * flight, and a late reply describing the PREVIOUS photo must not be shown as
 * the current one -- so every request carries an id and a reply for an id that
 * is no longer outstanding is dropped (`I6`, and `frontend/CLAUDE.md`'s rule
 * that asynchronous data belongs to the request that produced it).
 *
 * Second, failure: a worker that dies takes every pending promise with it
 * unless somebody rejects them, and a scan dialogue waiting forever on a
 * promise nobody will settle is the worst of the failure modes.
