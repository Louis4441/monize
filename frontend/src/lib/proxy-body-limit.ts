/**
 * How much of a request body the frontend will hold or pass on, per path.
 *
 * ## Why the ceiling lives in two places
 *
 * Next.js copies the body of every request the proxy (`src/proxy.ts`) matches
 * into memory BEFORE the proxy runs, up to `experimental.proxyClientMaxBodySize`
 * (`getCloneableBody` in `next/dist/server/body-streams.js`): one copy is handed
 * to the proxy, the other is kept to replace the request body afterwards, and
 * Next waits for the whole upload to arrive either way. Nothing the proxy does
 * -- refusing early, reading nothing -- shortens that, so the only bound on what
 * an unauthenticated request can make the frontend hold is that setting. It
 * used to be the `.mny` import ceiling (308 MB), for every path, which let a
 * single POST to `/api/v1/auth/login` pin hundreds of megabytes.
 *
 * So the setting is small (`NEXT_PROXY_CLIENT_MAX_BODY_MB`, one step above the
 * backend's own 10 MB JSON limit), and the few routes that genuinely need more
 * are kept out of the proxy's matcher entirely and served by route handlers
 * under `src/app/api/v1/` that STREAM the body to the backend with a per-route
 * ceiling (`LARGE_UPLOAD_ROUTES`, `forwardLargeUpload`). A request whose path
 * the proxy does match is refused with 413 past `DEFAULT_PROXY_BODY_LIMIT_BYTES`.
