/**
 * Every string this list shows a reader comes from a catalog.
 *
 * The first version of this guard listed the four literals that had just been
 * translated and asserted they were gone. That certifies a diff, not a rule:
 * two more English literals sat in the same component the whole time -- the
 * transfer chip's `` title={`Transfer to ${...|| 'account'}`} `` and the split
 * chip's `s.category?.name || 'Uncategorized'` -- and a test naming four
 * strings can only ever find those four.
 *
 * So this scans instead. The subject is every attribute a reader actually reads
 * (`title`, `aria-label`, `placeholder`, `alt`), and the rule is that after the
 * translator calls are blanked out, no prose literal is left in one. That is
 * mechanical, it covers a literal nobody has thought of yet, and it says
 * `path:line` when it fails.
 *
 * What it does NOT see, stated so the next reader does not over-trust it: a
 * literal assembled in a variable and passed in by name (the scan follows no
 * identifier), copy inside a `<span>` text child, a value coming from another
 * module, and anything outside the four attributes. It is a floor, not a proof.
 *
 * The source is read through `import.meta.glob`, like its siblings
 * (`SecurityTypeAllocationReport.i18n.guard.test.ts`,
 * `src/test/ui-conventions.test.ts`), because the previous `process.cwd()` join
 * resolves against wherever vitest was started -- it throws ENOENT the moment
 * the suite is run from the repository root rather than from `frontend/`.
