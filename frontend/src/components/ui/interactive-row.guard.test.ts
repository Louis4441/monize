/**
 * Guard for B4: keyboard activation of a non-button control is written once,
 * in `ui/interactive-row.ts`.
 *
 * The mistake this catches is mechanical and had already happened four times.
 * A `<tr>` with `onClick` and `cursor-pointer` needs `tabIndex` plus an
 * Enter/Space handler to be reachable at all, and a focus ring to be followable
 * -- three tables wrote both out by hand, character for character, and the
 * copies that came before them each drifted (a `focus:` ring that paints on a
 * mouse click, a ring with no inset offset). One copy that forgets the handler
 * is a row nothing but a mouse can use, and nothing fails.
 *
 * Two fingerprints, one per half:
 *
 *   1. a `key` comparison against BOTH `'Enter'` and `' '` in the same block --
 *      the activation contract, in either the negated-early-return or the
 *      positive-`if` form, since both shipped here;
 *   2. the inset focus ring's `outline-offset-[-2px]`, which is the ring's
 *      fingerprint (the colour and width utilities appear on their own
 *      elsewhere and mean other things).
 *
 * The comparison scan needs an offender list, because three call sites this
 * package does not own still hold a near-copy. They are recorded below with the
 * reason, and the list is SHRINK-ONLY: a file that no longer holds the pattern
 * fails its own entry, so a fix cannot leave a stale exemption covering the
 * next copy.
