 * Both render text nodes and anchors -- never markup from the string itself --
 * so the field stays plain text end to end: nothing is stored as HTML, no
 * sanitizer is relaxed, and the codebase's zero `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` count
 * is unchanged. What the reader sees is byte-for-byte what the writer typed;
 * only the affordance is new. `linkify.ts` holds that round trip as a test.
 *
 * `LinkifiedText` is for text being READ -- it draws the anchors in place.
 * `NoteLinks` is for text being EDITED, where that is impossible: a `<textarea>`
 * cannot contain an anchor, so the addresses are offered beneath the field
 * instead. Same parser, same anchor, so the two surfaces cannot disagree about
 * what counts as a link or how it opens.
