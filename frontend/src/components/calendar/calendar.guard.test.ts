 *
 * These are scans rather than paragraphs because each mistake they ban is
 * mechanical and locally plausible. Summing a day's chips into a day total is
 * four characters of `.reduce(` and reads as an obvious convenience; it is in
 * fact a currency-blind sum with no honest way to withhold itself when a rate
 * is missing (`docs/frontend/financial-figures.md`). Painting a percentage
 * green with a literal reads identically to calling `gainLossColor` and
 * diverges the moment the palette moves. Neither breaks a behaviour test, so
 * neither would be caught by one.
 *
 * Every block below pairs "the tree has no offender" with a planted fixture,
 * because a scan whose pattern has rotted passes over an empty set and reports
 * the same green as a clean tree (`docs/guard-tests.md`).
