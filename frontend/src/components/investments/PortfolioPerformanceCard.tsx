/**
 * What the portfolio earned over each trailing period, deposits taken out.
 *
 * Every figure comes from `GET /net-worth/investments-period-results` and
 * nothing here subtracts or divides: a change derived from the value series
 * counts the reader's own contributions as performance, which is the defect
 * INV-PORTRESULT-001 exists to stop (issue #1392).
 *
 * What it reports is the INVESTED part: `investmentReturnPercent`, the
 * server's time-weighted return over the securities alone, and
 * `investmentPnl` beneath it. Cash held in an investment account is not an
 * investment, so it is in neither figure and in neither the numerator nor the
 * base of the percentage: paying it in or out moves nothing here
 * (INV-PORTRESULT-002, `docs/specs/portfolio-period-result.md` section 10).
 * The account-level `investmentResult` and `returnPercent` still travel on the
 * same payload; they answer what the ACCOUNT did, which this card does not ask.
 *
 * A period the server could not report reads "n/a", the same answer the
 * security card gives for a window its history does not cover, and for the same
 * reason: a zero would be a claim that nothing happened. A request that has not
 * answered yet, or failed, leaves every period unknown rather than zero.
 *
 * WHICH windows there are is the server's answer too. The long ones (2Y, 5Y,
 * 10Y) come back only where the portfolio's history reaches them, and the
 * all-time row only where it has ever held anything, so this card lists the
 * windows it was sent rather than a fixed six. A row nobody can ever fill in
 * is not an "n/a" worth printing: unlike a window withheld for a missing
 * price, there is nothing to add. Until the server answers, the base windows
 * stand in, so the list grows into its full length instead of shrinking out of
 * a longer one.
