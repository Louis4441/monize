/**
 * The window a Portfolio Value chart requests, per range.
 *
 * **A portfolio chart opens its series on the close its figures are measured
 * from.** The figures are the server's (`usePortfolioPeriodResult`), measured
 * over the window `backend/src/net-worth/portfolio-period-presets.util.ts`
 * resolves for the range, so this table mirrors that file day for day:
 * `periodStart` is where the period opens (`presetWindowStart`) and `start` is
 * the day it is measured from (`presetEarliestDate`) -- the day before the
 * period for a range measured from the prior close (`usesPriorCloseBaseline`),
 * the period's own first day otherwise. `portfolio-range-window.test.ts` and
 * `portfolio-period-presets.util.spec.ts` pin the two files to the same dates.
 *
 * Separate from `resolveRangePreset` on purpose. That function answers "what
 * period is the user asking about", and ten other reports depend on its
 * answer -- a spending report's 3M window must not move when a price chart's
 * does. A rule naming an exact day overrides month alignment, which is why
 * these do not consult `options.alignment`: "the same day a year earlier" has
 * no month-aligned reading.
 *
 * | Range | Period opens | Measured from |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | 1D | unchanged (`resolveRangePreset` widens the daily fallback to a week) | the day before |
 * | 1W | 7 days back | the day before |
 * | MTD | the 1st | the last day of the previous month |
 * | 1M, 3M, 2Y | 30 / 90 / 730 days back | the same day |
 * | 6M | the same day six months earlier | the same day |
 * | YTD | 31 December of the previous year | the same day |
 * | 1Y, 5Y | the same day one / five years earlier | the same day |
 * | All, custom | unchanged | the same day |
 *
 * A day is valued from the latest close on or before it, so a `start` on a
 * weekend carries the previous session's close; the point is dated by that
 * session once the server names it (`openingSessionDate`).
