-- Web Push transport for the notification centre (discussion #1291, phase 2).
--
-- Two tables with deliberately different lifetimes:
--
--   * push_instance_config is the deployment's push identity -- one VAPID key
--     pair per Monize instance, generated on first start so a self-hosted
--     administrator registers nothing with Google, Apple or Firebase. The
--     private half is AES-256-GCM ciphertext under ENCRYPTION_KEY, so an
--     instance without that variable stores no key at all rather than a
--     plaintext secret. Deployment-wide state with no owner column, so the
--     table is RLS-exempt for the same reason provider_health is; the rationale
--     is in docs/row-level-security-contract.md and the list itself lives once,
--     in backend/src/common/db/rls-exempt-tables.ts.
--
--   * push_subscriptions is what a browser handed us: an endpoint at the push
--     service plus the two keys that encrypt to it. User-owned, so it carries
--     the uniform direct policy AND its own ENABLE (this migration is numbered
--     after 123_rls_enable.sql, which never runs again on a deployed database).
--
-- Neither table is exported by a backup: see INTENTIONALLY_EXCLUDED_TABLES in
-- backend/src/backup/export-table-queries.ts. A subscription names a browser on
-- one machine talking to one origin under one VAPID key, and restoring a
-- production backup onto a test instance must not hand that instance the right
-- to push to real phones.
